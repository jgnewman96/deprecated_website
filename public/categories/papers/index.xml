Paper Motivation Data is being collected ubiquitously. Tech companies are “moving fast and breaking“ things rather than thinking carefully about data storage
Paper Contribution The paper calls upon archival theory to understand control, power, subjectivity and emotion in computing practices related to data storage. The authors test their framework with an interview study. They end by sketching the implications of their framework and suggest having data management practices that focus on legacy, life transitions and control</description>

      <description>By Rachel Thomas and David Uminsky
Paper Motivation Optimizing a metric is central to current AI approaches. Metrics can lead to a myopic focus on short term goals leading to unexpected negative consequences. This reliance on metrics is a fundamental challenge of modern AI
Paper Contribution The paper reviews current examples of metrics gone wrong. The authors find the following problematic aspects of metrics
 Any metric is just a proxy for what we really care about Metrics can, and will be gamed Metrics tend to overemphasize short-term concerns Many online metrics are gathered in highly addictive environments  The authors create a framework to mitigate the harms of overemphasizing metrics by suggesting</description>

      <description>By Andrew Gelman and Guido Imbens
Paper Motivation Most statistics and economics literature focuses on the effect of a treatment not what caused an outcome.
Paper Contribution The authors argue that the search for a cause can be understood in a traditional statistical framework. We can think about identifying causes using model checking and hypothesis generation.
Background A map shows a high density of cancers in a small geographic region. This immediately leads to some questions → What is going on here?</description>

      <description>By Suining He and Kang Shin
Paper Motivation Accurate bike-flow prediction at the station level is important for a bike sharing service&amp;rsquo;s success. Existing methods are not successful at predicting fine-grained bike flow.
Paper Contribution The authors remedy this problem by proposing a spatiotemporal graph attention CNN for station-level flow prediction. Each bike station is a node and bike rides are edges on a graph. Their network captures differing station-to-station correlations.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/papers/2020/ml_harms_framework/</guid>
      <description>By Harini Suresh and John Guttag
Paper Motivation We need a better understanding of the potential unwanted consequences from machine learning. We often hear about “biased data“ but this term has become a catch all that prevents nuanced understanding.
Paper Contribution The authors propose a framework that partitions harms from machine learning into six different categories. The paper covers what contributes to each harm and how to remedy them. The authors argue it is critical that the solutions we develop are from application specific understandings rather than abstract notions of fairness.</description>

      <description>By Facebook Research
Papers Motivation Large distributed software systems with many users interacting are difficult to fully test. There are large numbers of edge cases which are difficult to identify ahead of time. Lots of bugs arise from complex interactions between users and the software that only occur at scale.
Papers Contribution This paper outlines the general principles of web enabled simulations (WES). The development of Facebook&amp;rsquo;s WW simulation is used to guide a discussion of WES in general.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/papers/2020/equalized_odds_supervised_learning/</guid>
      <description>Paper Motivation Model builders may want to ensure their model is fair with regard to a protected attribute. (E.g. Wanting to make sure our model is not discriminating against people because of their race). Previous research has shown that quantifying a model&amp;rsquo;s fairness is not straight forward. Even if the protected attribute is not an input to the model it is still possible that the model is discriminatory.
Paper Contribution The authors present a methodology of adjusting a learned predictor to remove discrimination according to their definition of discrimination.</description>

      <description>By Duri Long and Brian Magerko
Paper Motivation Artificial Intelligence is increasingly integrated into user-facing technology but public understanding is limited. We need more research investigating what users need to effectively interact with AI and how to design learner centered AI technologies that increase user understanding.
Paper Contribution This paper formally defines AI literacy based on other existing research. The authors synthesize interdisciplinary research into a set of core competencies. They also make design suggestions for creating learner centered AI</description>

      <title>Understanding Deep Learning Requires Re-thinking Generalization</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/papers/2020/rethinking_generalization/</link>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/papers/2020/rethinking_generalization/</guid>
      <description>By Chiyuan Zhang, Samy Bengio, Moritz Hardt, Benjamin Recht, Oriol Vinyals
Papers Motivation The authors note that successful deep learning models often exhibit small differences between training and test performance. This is generally attributed to modeling techniques that are supposed to achieve generalization, such as regularization.
Papers Contribution Using many experiments, the authors show that these traditional approaches do not provide a satisfactory answers for why deep learning generalizes well. Regularization is not what leads to good generalization, and state of the art deep learning can successfully fit random noise.</description>

      <description>By Jessica Su, Krishna Kamath, Aneesh Sharma, Johan Ugander, and Sharad Goel
This paper from Twitter and Stanford has the following motivation:
 The theory of structural diversity predicts that individuals derive increased utility from interacting with people from different parts of their social network. Previous evidence for this theory comes from observational studies which makes it difficult to make any casual statement.  So what is structural diversity? People consider the actions of their social contacts when making decisions.</description>

      <description>Paper by Augenstein et al.
I have stared a weekly reading group with my friend and former co-worker Tushar Chandra. Our format is that one person proposes a set of papers, and then the other picks a paper for the week.
Summary The authors motivate their paper with the following logical steps.
 Manual data inspection is a key part of the machine learning workflow There are occasions when manual data inspection is either undesirable or infeasible (privacy requirements, or federated learning where data is stored at the edge).</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/papers/2020/white_silence/</guid>
      <description>By Robin DiAngelo
The paper explores why white people are silent when talking about race. It argues that this silence, &amp;ldquo;White Silence&amp;rdquo; functions to maintain white power and privilege. The goal of the paper is to unsettle the complacency that often surrounds White Silence. TO motivate silent whites to stop being silent.
Whiteness is dynamic, relational and operating at all times and on myriad levels. It is not something simple and not easy to wrap our heads around.</description>

      <description>By Djallel Bouneffouf and Irina Rish
Summary The authors begin the paper by highlighting that Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms have gotten a lot of attention recently for their ability to learn with less feedback. Multi-Armed Bandit approaches thrive in situations where we can not use a supervised approach and have to make decisions with minimal feedback. This paper is a survey of the top recent developments in the field. They authors introduce a taxonomy to classify different types of MAB problems and explain the state of the art in each category.</description>

      <description>By Matthew R. Williams and Terrance D. Savitsky
Summary This paper provides a framework for creating survey weights using constrained optimization. The problem we are solving can be laid out in the following way:
We have a sample of size n taken from a population of size N. Each person in the population has a probability of being included in the survey. The probability of being in the sample is correlated with our response of interest.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/papers/2020/silver_bullet/</guid>
      <description>By Fredrick P Brooks
Summary This paper was published in 1986 examining the difficulties of creating software. Brooks argues that there is no silver bullet to make software development a lot easier. The main things that are making software development hard are part of the essence of software development. Rather than aiming for a silver bullet that will greatly improve software development we should be making smaller iterative improvements.
Brooks argues that Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law and a two fold increase in productivity each year is a fools goal for software.</description>

      <description>Summary This paper explores matching in two sided markets through the multi armed bandit problem. An example of a two sided market we can model using multi armed bandits is matching workers to employees. There is a pool of workers and a pool of employees. We want to find the optimal matching of employees and workers. Employees have preferences over workers, and workers have preferences over employees. There has been a lot of working that examines how to achieve an optimal matching.</description>

      <description>Summary The authors outline that due to decreasing performance of phone polls new approaches to political polling are becoming prominent. These new methods of getting survey responses do not get perfectly random samples. The authors argue we can use new statistical methods to make accurate inference without random samples.
The authors lay out the following work flow:
 Draw a survey sample directly from the voter database or matching responses from an already existing survey to the database Use auxiliary data from the database to construct a flexible statistical model on the quantity (or quantities) of interest Project inferences from the statistical model to the full target population on an individual level Use the projected individual-level inferences, which can be seen as a pseudo-survey dataset, to construct larger group-level inferences about either the electorate as a whole or subgroups within the electorate.</description>

      <description>By Paul H. Garthwaite, Joseph B. Kadane and Anthony O’Hagan
Summary This paper is an overview of how to take experts believes and turn them into statistical distributions. It combines a long line of psychology research with statistics research. The situation we are examining is when we want to create a distribution over a value from an experts opinion. It is impossible to ask an expert to give us a probability distribution so we need a methodology to query an expert that allows us to create the distribution ourselves.</description>

Summary The authors propose that machine learning models should be accompanied by documentation known as &amp;ldquo;model cards&amp;rdquo;. A model card should outline who built the model, what the purpose of the model is, how it was validated and what it&amp;rsquo;s performance is according to many different metrics. The authors focus on models that are making decisions about humans.</description>

Summary This paper creates a model of how scientific researchers make progress towards the truth. By examining this process under different conditions the authors were able to identify what characteristics help lead scientists towards the truth. This work was motivated by understanding the role that reproducibility has in the research process. Through experiments with different conditions the authors were able to reach some conclusions about how reproducibility and other characteristics affect a communities ability to find the truth.</description>

Summary This paper by two attorneys at Bronx Defenders argues that quick, decisive, and aggressive action can return children to parents after abuse allegations much faster than traditional approaches. The authors outline how minority and low income parents are more frequently accused of abuse. Parents will bring their children to the Emergency Room in response to accidental injuries or strange physical developments. When the parents explanation for how the injury occurred is not deemed sufficient by the physician, they will be accused of abuse.</description>
