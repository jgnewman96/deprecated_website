      <description>Transcendent Kingdom is Yaa Gyasi&amp;rsquo;s second novel. I really enjoyed reading Homegoing a couple of years ago which made me excited to pick up this novel. The novel is told from the perspective of Gifty a neuroscience PHD student who grew up in Alabama. Gifty&amp;rsquo;s mom emigrated from Ghana with her husband shortly after Gifty&amp;rsquo;s older brother was born. The novel tells the story of Gifty&amp;rsquo;s life by intermingling stories from the past with the present.</description>

      <description>Seeing Like A State is one of professor James Scott&amp;rsquo;s most well know pieces. It takes a comprehensive look at high modernism and why certain approaches to improve outcomes have failed. The book is centered on understanding what measures have been used to simplify very complex behavior. Through a few in depth case studies the book highlights how this simplified understanding can lead to bad outcomes. It is not that this simplification inherently leads to bad outcomes but when it is combined with the believe that you can do no wrong, it will often lead to those in power hurting others.</description>

      <description>The Hidden Girl and Other Stories by Ken Liu us a book of short science fiction stories. There is one set of stories that is a trilogy but otherwise each story is a standalone.
There were a lot of stories in this collection and I found most of them to be a little underwhelming. There was one story though that I thought was very powerful. The story was about charitable giving and how we think about our own impacts on the world.</description>

      <description>Conversations on Writing is a short book of three conversations between Ursula K. Le Guin and David Naimon about writing. One conversation is about fiction, one is on poetry and the last is on non-fiction. This conversations are quite in depth and show how Le Guin thinks about writing. Le Guin has published some of my favorite books so it was an absolute pleasure to hear about her creative process and how she sees the world.</description>

      <description>The Memory Police By Yoko Ogawa is a very slow paced unnerving science-fiction novel. The novel takes place on an island where objects are slowly disappearing from people&amp;rsquo;s memory. One day everyone wakes up and they no longer have the memory about a certain object. They proceed to destroy all instances of that object. This forgetfulness does not impact everyone on the island though. There are some people who do not forget.</description>

      <description>Men We Reaped By Jesmyn Ward is an incredibly powerful and moving book. Ward tells a story of growing up in Mississippi and the impact it had on her community. The story looks specifically at the death of five men who were quite close to her. She tells the story from both sides. She has chapters that start at the present and work there ways backwards and chapters that start at her birth and work forwards.</description>

      <description>Stories of Your Life and Others is a book of science fiction short stories by Ted Chiang. Chiang is one of my favorite writers. I love the way he brings real science into his science fiction. He is not writing about completely fictional worlds. He uses science fiction to force us to think about our own world and our own science in a different way.
This book is for sure weaker than his other book of short stories Exhalation.</description>

      <title>Golden Gates: Fighting for Housing in America</title>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2020/golden_gates/</guid>
      <description>Golden Gates by Conor Daugherty tells a meandering story of housing in the Bay Area. It combines individual stories focused on specific actors with a larger look at housing policy. We hear about community activists, politicians and people being forced from their homes. It combines a larger argument about problems with housing with an in depth looking at how the housing crisis impacts individual people.
Reading The Color of Law by Richard Rothstein gave me a sense of historical patterns and how the housing market has become so inequitable.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2020/beloved/</guid>
      <description>Beloved by Toni Morrison is truly a heart breaking novel. It builds up to that heartbreak in an incredibly nuanced manner. It does not throw you directly into what happened with Sethe or what her past is like. It tells the story from a couple of different perspectives with different pieces getting peeled back in different ways. The book keeps you unsettled by slowly revealing more information. This leads to a greater understanding of Sethe and why she took the actions that she did.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2020/do_nothing/</guid>
      <description>How to Do Nothing By Jenny Odell is a meandering book focused on how to change our relationship with technology and those around us. While it would be easy to classify this book as self-help, it does not feel as sure of itself as other self-help books. Self help books often are written from the perspective of an all knowing author who has everything figured out and wants to share their knowledge with the feeble reader.</description>

      <description>The Color Purple has been my list since I went to a meditation retreat earlier this year led by Rhonda Magee. She highly recommended reading this novel and remarked a number of times about how powerful it is.
The Color Purple touches on a couple of deep and complex subjects in a short space. It conveys emotions on these subjects in a different way because it is a piece of fiction.</description>

      <description>I have read Atul Gawande&amp;rsquo;s writing in the New Yorker over the past year was quite impressed. He has a very measured tone and is very persuasive. Being Mortal was the only one of his books available at the library.
The best non-fiction books are those that combine stories with an analytical view. If it is only stories then often times the book is not making a larger point. Just an analytical argument can often miss the human side of a topic and can be a dry read.</description>

      <description>Wow, this book absolutely wrecked me. It is easily one of the saddest books I have read recently. It is a different kind of sad than other sad books I have read. Non-fiction often can be quite sad. But this book is just heartbreaking in how relatable it is. The stories are not wrapped up with nice clean resolutions. Characters do not always get redemption. The stories just really hit home.</description>

      <description>This book was such a good read, I loved learning the fundamentals of cooking. Most other recipe books give you a bunch of recipes but never explain why something tastes good or why flavors go together. I have been drifting towards this approach to cooking for a while now. I was trying not to follow recipes, but instead use recipes as inspiration. It never felt like following a recipe exactly by the book was sustainable.</description>

      <description>Reading Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells really lit a fire under me with regard to climate change. Climate Change is something that does not impact my day to day and so it can be easy to not be thinking about it. It is not top of my mind when I am wasting energy or thinking about flying to visit a friend.
The beginning of the book is extremely powerful. It has a number of different chapters all devoted to the different ways climate change is harming our planet.</description>

      <description>On Earth We&amp;rsquo;re Briefly Gorgeous By Ocean Vuong is a novel from the perspective of a narrator writing to his mother. The narrator recounts many different stories from his childhood and his relationship with different influences in his life. The letter jumps all over the place recounting stories about his Grandma&amp;rsquo;s life, to segments from the narrators point of view now that he is an adult.
This book reminded me in a lot of ways of some passages in Severance.</description>

      <description>The Color of Law By Richard Rothstein provides an extensive history of discrimination in housing policy in the United States. Rothstein chronicles discrimination at all levels of government and in all facets of housing. Whether it is discrimination through zoning, mortgages or schools, different levels of government continued to find new ways to enforce segregation. Rothstein refutes that housing segregation is a result of people&amp;rsquo;s preferences. He shows that housing segregation is a direct result of governmental policies that still impact our country today.</description>

      <description>Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo is a mix of a novel with a set of short stories. Each chapter is told from the perspective of a different women in England. Some of the stories are set in the present and some of them are set a hundred years ago. The stories cover a vast range of different experiences from people who grew up very poor to people who grew up with some wealth.</description>

      <description>Twitter and Tear Gas By Zeynep Tufekci is a pointedly insightful read. I had been planning to read it ever since she was interviewed on Stratechery. It felt like a really good time to read this book with the BLM protests going on across the world. Twitter and Tear Gas is part a history of modern protests, part a personal reflection and part a deep dive on the societal impacts of technology.</description>

      <description>Hacking the Electorate By Eitan Hersh is an depth look at what information is accessible to campaigns and how they use that information to interact with voters. Hersh contextualizes his work by highlighting that he is focusing on the perspective of a campaign. A lot of previous research is through the lense perspective of voters. Hersh&amp;rsquo;s main argument is that by looking through the perspective of campaigns we can understand how campaigns perceive voters.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2020/exhalation/</guid>
      <description>Exhalation by Ted Chiang is a set of short stories that really showcases some of what I love about sci-fi. Chiang uses each story to explore our contemporary culture in a way that is only possible through sci-fi. Good science fiction is not writing about a different. It is writing about our own society and using other places to provide a context that would not be possible otherwise. By looking at and asking questions about what the world would look like in other scenarios we can better understand our own world.</description>

      <description>Hyperion by Dan Simmons is likely to join the group of sci-fi series where I read the first novel in the series and then do not read the others. This in no way means that I did not enjoy the book, but I find the first book in sci-fi series to be the most compelling. The world building and the introduction of characters is so gripping. There are so many books out there that I am compelled to read and so I often do not continue with the series.</description>

      <description>Trick Mirror by Jia Tolentino is a series of essays exploring identity and the self in our current era. Tolentino blends personal stories and self reflections with larger dissections of structural systems in our society. I found Tolentino&amp;rsquo;s writing incredibly compelling. She does not prescribe absolutes and allows nuance to shine through. She does not prescribe exact solutions but rather examines structures in our society and how she navigates them.</description>

      <description>Conversations with Friends is the second book in the past month that I have read by Sally Rooney. Similarly to Normal People, this novel explores communication between people in romantic relationships. It highlights the dangers and destructive nature of expecting others to understand us. When we expect others to understand rather than communicating there will be failures. We make assumptions about how other people are processing events and get caught in the world inside our heads.</description>

      <description>Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to a Tribe Called Quest is a beautiful book. It blends a memoir, with a history of a rap group, with a history of a time period. While the book is ostensibly about the rap group, it actualls talks about so much more than one rap group. Abdurraqib writes a poetic style of prose that conveys so much emotion.
Abdurraqib writes through the lense of his personal experience with the group.</description>

      <description>Severance by Ling Ma is easily one of my favorite books of the year. Severance elegantly ties together many different genres. It is an immigrant story, a coming of age story, a story about heritage and an apocalypse story. Ma blends these different stories into one cohesive narrative. Often during apocalypse novels the majority of the focus is on surviving and how the world has changed. Tieing the apocalypse to an individual&amp;rsquo;s history allowed us to explore how Candace&amp;rsquo;s past impacted her actions during the apocalypse.</description>

      <description>Reading Catch and Kill by Ronan Farrow was a real eye opener for me. I knew who Harvey Weinstein was but I did not know any of the details. A lot of the events covered in the book happened while I was in college when I did not really follow the news.
My largest takeaway was that while the book might be centered on Harvey Weinstein, it is actually about so much more than any individual man.</description>

      <description>Normal People by Sally Rooney is one of my most anticipated books in the past couple of years. I had heard from many different sources about how good this book is. Family, friends and numerous co-workers all recommended it highly. It is relatively rare that I hear praise about a book from so many different sources.
I can see why so many different people enjoyed Rooney&amp;rsquo;s writing. She does an incredible job portraying emotion and what it feels like to be in your late teens / early twenties.</description>

      <description>I was introduced to this book through Stratechery and Exponent. One of the co-hosts of Exponent, James Allworth, is a co-author of this book. While I have been reading Ben Thompson&amp;rsquo;s (the author of Stratechery) writing for a couple years now, I knew a lot less about Allworth and his background. While James is a co-author of this book, the book is written from the perspective of Clayton Christensen. Christensen a professor at Harvard Business School, is best known for his work The Innovator&amp;rsquo;s Dillema.</description>

      <description>I have read a book by Ta-Nehisi Coates each of the past two years. I read Between the World and Me two years ago and We Were Eight Years In Power last year. Both books demonstrated Coates impressive ability to forcefully convey powerful ideas. Coates is a masterful essayist. I listened to him and his editor Chris Jackson discuss The Water Dancer on the podcast Longform. I was quite excited to read Coates first novel and see how his writing style translated to a completely different medium.</description>

      <description>I have read a lot of &amp;ldquo;pop&amp;rdquo; science books and Good Economics for Hard Times is easily the best. Duflo and Banerjee explore very complex topics with nuance. They do an incredible job of conveying where there is uncertainty and what we know more definitively. Duflo and Banerjee both review the existing literature and expand upon potential future directions. Good Economics for Hard Times provides structure for thinking about complex problems like immigration or automation.</description>

      <description>Before reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance I had no knowledge about what genre the book was or what it would be about. I actually potentially had some misconceptions about the content of the book. While I reading it, I actually thought it was a piece of fiction. Only when I read the afterword did I learn that it was actually semi auto-biographical. My friend Abhisaar recommended this book and I finally got around to it after about two years.</description>

      <description>Braiding Sweet Grass is a set of short stories about nature from Robin Kimmerer&amp;rsquo;s life. Kimmerer blends a scientific perspective with a perspective from from her heritage as a Native American. While each story is about an individual relationship between humans and nature, she often makes larger points about how human view themselves in the world. Kimmerer questions human&amp;rsquo;s claim of intelligent supremacy, challenges some of our economic systems and laments different ways our society is narrow minded.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2020/sing_unburied/</guid>
      <description>Sing, Unburied Sing is a novel by Jesmyn Ward set in the American South. As with Ward&amp;rsquo;s other books, the novel does such an incredible job of getting inside characters heads. Ward is able to convey characters as nuanced individuals. She shows the darkest parts of our internal minds, how complex and convoluted they can be.
Sing, Unburied Sing feels like it is building towards something for the first half of the book.</description>

      <description>Silent Spring is the environmentalist Rachel Carson&amp;rsquo;s classic piece covering the dangers of pesticides. Carson explores the dangers of pesticides from so many different angles building up an intense amount of evidence of the dangers of pesticides. She highlights how harmful pesticides are to many different parts of our planet. The book is nothing if not repetitive show casing over and over again how we are doing damage to the planet with pesticides.</description>

      <description>American Marriage by Tayari Jones is an absolutely gripping novel about a couple where the husband goes to jail for a crime he did not commit. The novel is written from the perspective of three different characters in long form first person monologues. I have not read a book in a while that was as gripping as American Marriage. There is something so powerful about first person internal monologues. The book is paced in a way that things are constantly turning and changing in different directions.</description>

      <title>2019 in Review: The Books I Read</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/year_review_2019/</link>

      <description>As another year passes I reflect on what I did over the past year and what I learned. Looking back it is tempting to focus on what has changed over the past year. It is tempting to compare where I am now and where I was a year ago. I have moved to a new city and started a new job. But comparing one year to another is so divorced from the actual experience of a year.</description>

      <description>There Eyes Were Watching God is a novel about Janie, an African American Women born shortly after the end of slavery. The novel follows her she moves through three different husbands and living situations. This book is the most well known piece of literature by Zora Neale Hurston. The book is often read in English classes in either high school or college. I never read There Eyes Were Watching God in school; I was in the other 10th grade english class.</description>

      <description>Lords of the Realm by John Helyar chronicles the history of baseball through the eyes of the owners. We generally learn about the history of sports through the great players and their influence on the game. This book looks at the owners and how they shaped the game of baseball as it developed. The book is particularly focused on the labor relations between the players and the owners.
This book showed a completely different side of baseball history than I am used to.</description>

      <description>My Year of Rest and Relaxation by Otessa Moshfegh is quite a trip. The reader is taken inside the mind of a young adult living in New York who is trying to sleep for a entire year. The main character&amp;rsquo;s parents died and she recently left her job. She is using medication to sleep as much as possible. She hopes that after a year of sleeping she will be able to have a new start and be divorced from the darkness of her previous life.</description>

      <description>Creativity Inc was a fantastic book looking at the culture of Pixar. It explained the founding of Pixar and how the founders maintain an intense focus on developing a fantastic culture. The founders believe that if they maintain a good culture, their business will thrive. A successful business is not about having a great product plan, but developing a good culture and empowering smart people.
I appreciated that the book did not prescribe easy solutions but discussed everything with nuance.</description>

      <description>Washington Black by Esi Edugyan was quite an enjoyable piece of historical fiction. Here are a couple of different themes that personally stuck out to me.
Science as an equalizer The book played around a couple of different times with the idea that science and viewing the world through a scientific lens is an equalizer. That if you viewed the world through a scientific lens then you would not discriminate against certain people and you would be better able to see the truth.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2019/omnivore/</guid>
      <description>The Omnivore&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma by Michael Pollan was an absolutely fascinating read. I enjoyed learning more about our food insutry and how the human food chain has developed. The central question of the book was where does our food come from? What seems like such a simple question has become quite complex in our modern society. I learned a lot by watching Michael try to answer this question.
  While this book dealt explicitly with our food chain, it raises a lot of questions about the complexity of our society today.</description>

      <description>I read this book because of a recommendation from my friend Hawkins. I had previously read a couple of other books by Ursula Le Guin. I absolutely loved both Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed. Both were sci-fi books that were actually commentaries on human society. I cannot get enough of books like that. Hawk had mentioned that this book was about a communist society and what that would look like.</description>

      <description>It is that time of year again when every website is publishing some piece of content trying to sum up 2018. Whether it is Facebook, posting a video that is your year in review, or a march madness style bracket to determine what person, place, or thing won 2018, everybody is attempting to summarize the past year.
A lot has happened over the past year. In 2018, I graduated college and started my first full time job.</description>
