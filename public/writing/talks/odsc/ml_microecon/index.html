<p>Talk given by <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/">Michael I Jordan</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-machine-learning">What is Machine Learning?</h2>

<p>The talk started by Professor Jordan defining what Machine Learning is. He said that machine learning is not some new field of research but it is rather the engineering extension of statistics. He calls back to how there was chemistry for a long time before there was chemical engineering. There was physics and electrical theory before there was electrical engineering.</p>

<p>Machine Learning is a new branch of engineering and we are still very early on in it&rsquo;s development. There are many issues that we still need to answer. How do we think about robustness and fairness of systems?</p>

<p>There was been an insane amount of hype about Machine Learning but it is still in its infancy. Essentially all of Machine Learning is still just pattern recognition. Deep learning is pattern recognition on steroids. But pattern recognition is not good enough to make decisions. We often need more the pattern recognition to make decisions</p>

<h2 id="where-is-machine-learning-going">Where is Machine Learning Going?</h2>

<p>Currently Machine Learning has really been limited to individual systems solving individual tasks. Where it becomes exciting is when we start to think about complex systems interacting. A large interconnected web of data, agents and decisions. We want our overall system to be intelligent.</p>

<p>An example of an intelligent system is a market. A market is a large decentralized system that organizes resources. Markets are scalable, robust, adaptive and have a very long lifetime.</p>

<p>An example of a market is Uber. It is a platform that brings together consumers and producers. There is a lot of Machine Learning that makes the Uber platform possible. We could imagine a similar platform but for many other use cases as well. Medicine, Commerce etc..</p>

<p>Imagine if we thought of Youtube as a connection between producers and consumers. That would completely change how Youtube was monetized and how we interacted with the platform. We have seen that people are willing to give up a little bit of privacy for value. It is essentially a market where agents interact with each other by recommendation systems. We can then use Microeconomics in conjecture with Machine Learning to think about how these systems function.</p>

<h2 id="ml-and-decision-making">ML and Decision Making</h2>

<p>In Machine Learning decision marking is often simplified to just a threshold. If our value is larger than some threshold we make one decision and if it is smaller we make another decision. But real world decisions have consequences. Also, imagine we are not thinking about just one decision put a set of decisions? Decisions over time? Decisions where there is scarcity?</p>

<p>To ground this in an example imagine we are recommending movies to people. What happens if we recommend the same movie to every individual. No problem. But what about if we recommend the same restaurant? or the same street to drive on. Then we have a series problem. Instead what we can do is create a market. We can connect producers and consumers.</p>

<p>Professor Jordan is arguing that markets are the future because with a market you are providing a real service. This is a sustainable business model rather than the advertising business models we currently have where organizations are harvesting people&rsquo;s data. They key comes from the connection between the digital world and the real world.</p>

<p>Currently there is not any economic value in the music industry. It is is very difficult for most people to make a living being a musician. Instead how could we create a market for music? We can provide data to musicians to let them learn where their audience is. A Musician can give a show where they have an audience. There is actual already a company doing this: <a href="https://unitedmasters.com/">united masters</a></p>

<h2 id="my-thoughts">My thoughts</h2>

<p>I have a lot of mixed feelings about this talk. When I initially heard it I loved it. But when I was writing up my notes, I was not loving it as much. The talk was given in a short amount of time and did not go into much of the actual research around this motivation. I love the idea of machine learning not being some new field but rather just an engineering discipline.</p>

<p>I am not sure I agree with the whole argument that most digital systems right now are not creating value and that it showed be a market. Spotify is creating value not by giving you a place to listen to music, but by making it so so easy. It also has a lot of services such as recommendation that are really nice. Do I wish that more of the value in the eco system went to the people actually producing the music than Spotify? For sure. But this is the whole shift that the internet has brought about. Suppliers are not the people who are in control anymore. They are a commodity.</p>

<p>I think there is a very careful discussion that needs to be fleshed here about how the digital world intersects with the physical world. How do these two worlds interact and how does value in one, translate to value in another? Michael Jordan was arguing that Uber&rsquo;s business model is a good one, but the problem is that Uber&rsquo;s business model does not have the same return on investment as a software as a service company. Software as a service companies have essentially zero marginal cost. Uber has quite a high marginal cost of every transaction. Uber is also constantly worried about bringing suppliers and demanders (drivers and users) onto the platform. So far we have not seen that Uber&rsquo;s business model is successful.</p>

<p>So while I do agree that complex systems are where things are headed with many different interactions. I am not sure I agree that markets are a better business proposition than other approaches.</p>
