<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Even if we build the most incredible thing, if it is not designed with users in mind, no body will use it. If we have built something that nobody will use, is it even incredible. If nobody is using what we have built than that is a failing.</p>
<p>We can build tools that users actually care about and will use if we take a user-centered design approach.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-user-centered-design">What is User-Centered Design?</h2>
<p>User centered design is  a frame work for problem solving where users are the vocal point. Users are at the center of everything. We explicitly acknowledge that are users are human which introduces a lot of new social and emotional factors. We care about how our tools make users feel.</p>
<p>User centered define can be broken down into the following five step iterative process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Empathize - We begin in an exploratory phase that is very open where we are just trying to understand</li>
<li>Define - We synthesize the results of empathizing into more concrete segments of work. We still keep users at the center of everything by using user stories. We are essentially making technical requirements from a users perspective.</li>
<li>Ideate - We bring users into the ideation phase having them help us brainstorm how to solve the problem.</li>
<li>Prototype - We want to get our solution back in front of the user as quickly as possible so that we can get their feedback.</li>
<li>Test - Iterate, Iterate Iterate. We testing something out, see how the user responds and then try something new out.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end the strict process or framework is not that important. It is all about having the correct mindset.</p>
<h2 id="principles-of-user-center-design">Principles of User-Center Design</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understand your users, tasks and environments</p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to recognize you are unique and that other people are  different from you.Work to identify how they are different  and how they are similar.</li>
<li>Understand the environments, that your users work in. What are there constraints?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep users involved throughout the process</p>
<ul>
<li>It is unrealistic for you to have solved the entire problem up front. Constantly get feedback from your users as you go.</li>
<li>This makes it much less likely you do a lot of work that you did not need to do. you do not need all of the answers up front</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the whole user experience</p>
<ul>
<li>It is critical to zoom out. Do not just think about the individual task but identify the larger picture.</li>
<li>Ask your users what marks success in their job? This question is so important, because it gives us the context for what we are trying to achieve</li>
<li>We want to understand the entire workflow rather than a specific solution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate</p>
<ul>
<li>We need a way to measure if what we are doing are is successful.</li>
<li>Here are some heuristics for usability taken from Jakob Nielsen&rsquo;s paper <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">10 usability heuristics for user interface design</a></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><em>Visibility of system status</em>
<ul>
<li>do users get feedback on  their progress? how much longer do they need to wait?</li>
<li>This is critical to building trust in the user</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Have Consistency and Standards</em>
<ul>
<li>example is a search bar</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Error Prevention</em>
<ul>
<li>try to prevent user errors from the start. If you know a system has constraints build them in</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</em>
<ul>
<li>you should not be able to take anything else away and still solves the problem</li>
<li>Ask yourself does what you are adding help guide the user or distract them?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors</em>
<ul>
<li>explain to user how to fix their error</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iteration</p>
<ul>
<li>You should always be learning and striving to make a better product</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="my-thoughts">my thoughts</h2>
<p>I love so many of the tenants and focus of this talk. User centric design is such a key to making products that actually have an impact. I believe academia would benefit so much from taking this approach. So much of academia is not user friendly and almost purposely inaccessible. I know there is a section of academia that focus on study design techniques, but really user centered design should under-pin everything.</p>
<p>This talk seemed mostly to be about software design. Or their approaches just seemed to be about design in general. I was hoping they would talk specifically about what this means for a data scientist. One thing I was thinking is that you could apply this by saying data scientists have to use algorithms that are interpretable. If the algorithm is not interpretable good change the user will not understand it and it will not be accessible. A user centered design approach would mean making models that are transparent and anyone can understand and interact with.</p>
