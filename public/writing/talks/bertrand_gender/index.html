    <div align="start" class="content"><p>This was a talk given at the American Economic Association (AEA) conference at the beginning of January 2020 by Marianne Bertrand. I was recommended this talk by Jenny Wang.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Bertrand begins her talk by highlighting that overall gender differences / bias are heading in the right direction. We see an optimistic story when we look at the wrong trends in gender differences. There are more females in the labor force and less of a difference in girls schooling. Currently, women make on average 84 cents for every dollar that a man makes in OECD countries. That is the smallest difference in history.</p>
<p>Bertrand reminds us to to remember this background as she talks about some of the remaining pain points. There are two key factors that play a part in this difference between men and women&rsquo;s pay.</p>
<h4 id="educational-choices">Educational Choices</h4>
<p>While there is a smaller gap between genders in level of educational attainment there is still a very large gap in educational field distribution. There is a much higher proportion of men who get degrees in STEM fields than women. This is important because STEM educations generally lead to well paying careers. Differences in education choices between the two genders explain 6 per cent of the difference in average income. There is also evidence that within STEM jobs there is less of a pay gap between men and women then in other fields.</p>
<h4 id="penalty-of-parenthood">Penalty of Parenthood</h4>
<p>Becoming a parent has a much larger penalty on income for women than it does for men. Becoming a father has essentially a non material impact on a mens income where as become a mother brings down a women&rsquo;s income by a fair amount. In Denmark 80 to 85 percent of the earnings difference can be explain by this difference in penalty of a child.</p>
<p>So what does the literature say about why this parenthood penalty exists? There are a couple of different contributing factors</p>
<ul>
<li>Women will often exit the workforce or switch to part time after becoming a mother</li>
<li>The school day has a different timing then the work day and therefore women need more flexible jobs. More flexible jobs often lead to a decrease in pay.</li>
<li>Women look for jobs that are closer to home because they want shorter commutes. This depresses their earnings potential by limiting the pool of available jobs.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Now that we understand what are the two driving differences behind this gap, Bertrand tries to give us a structured way to think about this differences. She highlights two possible explanations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Men and women make different choices because of differences in skills or preferences. This is due to an inherent difference in the gender.</li>
<li>The differences we observe above are a result of very powerful stereotypes that are engrained in our culture.
<ul>
<li>It is quite difficult to observe differences in skills or choices when those differences might be a result of these stereotypes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Bertrand then highlighted two different approaches to thinking about stereotypes. One is the traditional economic perspective and one is the perspective from social psychology.</p>
<p>The traditional economic perspective focus on the descriptive nature of stereotypes. Stereotypes are believes about who women and men are and what they will be. This perspective argues that agents are still rational and that the stereotypes are because of imperfect information. We have stereotypes because we do not have all of the information and are making an inference with only partial or incorrect information.</p>
<p>The social psychology perspective argues that stereotypes are cognitive generalizations so that we can save cognitive resources. Stereotypes do not need to be accurate or rational. It also highlights that stereotypes are not only descriptive but prescriptive. They are making an argument about how people out to be. This prescriptive view is arguing that stereotypes are reinforcing. People act in certain ways because that is what is deemed as normal. There is a fair amount of evidence that stereotypes are not only descriptive but in fact are prescriptive.</p>
<p>The prescriptive view of stereotypes highlights that rational self interest plays a part in gender norms. When a rational agent is making a choice they are weighing the cost and benefits. They calculate that there is a consequence of acting in consistently with gender stereotypes. If we accept this conclusion it means that preferences are ambiguous because they are effect by gender norms. We therefore cannot conclude that these differences are driven by preferences because preferences are dictated by gender norms. In this context talking about preferences is really meaningless.</p>
<p>Similarly to preferences, skill can also be a result of existing stereotypes. When math teachers have gender stereotypes about girls being worse at math, that leads to girls actually performing worse at math. There is empirical evidence that the larger gender stereotypes are in a country, the larger the gender gap in math is. Bertrand also brought up the point that it is very difficult to use self reported data when people&rsquo;s behavior is being driven by gender norms.</p>
<hr>
<p>Bertrand next discussed why there might be some gender gaps. A hypothesis that she highlighted is that even if girls have equal levels of ability with boys at math, they choose to go into a non-stem field because that is where they have a comparative advantage. This mean that even if women are equal with boys at math, if they are better at literature they will go into the literature fields.</p>
<p>Bertrand also wanted to see if our current believes about gender are even accurate. If you at almost any given trait, the within gender variation for both men and women is a lot larger than the between gender variation. This means that the are much larger differences between men in most traits then the differences between men and women are.</p>
<p>Next she discussed how certain types of stereotypes are stronger than others. She examined the difference between the strength of a stereotype and measurable difference between two genders. For example, how much do people perceive women to be kinder than men, and how much kinder are women than men. She found that the stereotypes which first came to people&rsquo;s mind were the ones with the largest gap between perceived differences and actual differences.</p>
<p>She next showed graphs of trends in different types of stereotypes over time. It appears the stereotypes about competence and intelligence are going away. For example, a lot less people now think that men are inherently smarter than women. Stereotypes are about agency and communion though are decreasing. It is very difficult to talk about gender stereotypes in general without examining specific gender stereotypes.</p>
<p>The last point she made in this section is that positive gendered stereotypes might be less likely to change but still can have negative impacts. People might think you are a bigot for saying women are less intelligent than men, but might not a problem if you say women are kinder than men. This type of stereotype can still negatively impact women though.</p>
<hr>
<p>Bertrand ended her presentation discussing how all of these findings should impact how we think about stereotypes. SHe began the section that more research on a lot of this topics is needed and that there needs to be more incentives for people in the field to do different types of new research.</p>
<p>Research has shown that the most powerful counter to stereotypes is exposure to thing which go against the stereotype. This has the implications that we should avoid policies that take women out of the work force. While a more generous maternity leave sounds good in principle, it has the potentially negative effect of taking women out of the work force. Instead we could think of a policy that puts more of the parental burden on men and provides paternal leave. She also highlighted that joint taxation can depress women&rsquo;s work by putting them in a higher tax bracket than individual taxation.</p>
<p>In general, we need more policies that are gender neutral. There should also be more government spending on child care and education. We should institute polices that counter stereotypes by ensuring father take time off around their child&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p>Bertrand then discussed how we can think about organizational practices and gender roles. In a lot of organizations there is an increased reward for inflexible or unstable work. This type of work is often more of a burden on women who are tasked with child chare. This is a collective action problem where each firm is solving their own cost minimization problem, but no one is internalizing the costs to society as a whole.There is also evidence that sexual harassment is more common with unstable or inconsistent work.</p>
<p>Rather than talking about diversity and inclusion, we should discuss inclusion and diversity. Diversity does not mean anything if it does not include people. The idea of diversity reinforces us seeing gender rather than being inclusive of all. We should constantly be vigilant that stereotypes could be anywhere. Fast systems where people are making quick decisions is more likely to have stereotypes that slower systems.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wow, Wow, Wow. So much ground was covered in this talk it was kind of incredible. Bertrand was able to discuss so much different literature and connect it to tell a story so well. It is very impressive to me when people are able to connect so much work to tell cohesive narratives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stereotypes are very difficult to think about and Bertrand helped the audience build that tool kit from the ground up. So much discussion in day to day life about stereotypes can feel kind of wishy washy. Bertrand was able to highlight so much research and gives us a tool kit to think about stereotypes. I feel much more equipped to think about why stereotypes exist and how to combat them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really appreciated her highlighting the limitations of the economic perspective anc how much she has learned from social psychology. She also called out the need for different types of research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One thing that really stuck with me was some of her policy implications. Like the idea that increasing maternal leave is actually potentially harmful. Or that girls choose to go into fields of literature because that is where their comparative advantage is. A solution to this might be to make boys better at reading. A lot of interesting policy discussions. I loved that she went from initial research all the way to how we can create better policy.</p>
