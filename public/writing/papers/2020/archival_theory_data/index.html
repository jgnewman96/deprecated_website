<h3 id="paper-motivation">Paper Motivation</h3>
<p>Data is being collected ubiquitously. Tech companies are “moving fast and breaking“ things rather than thinking carefully about data storage</p>
<h3 id="paper-contribution">Paper Contribution</h3>
<p>The paper calls upon archival theory to understand control, power, subjectivity and emotion in computing practices related to data storage. The authors test their framework with an interview study. They end by sketching the implications of their framework and suggest having data management practices that focus on legacy, life transitions and control</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>People have an instinct to collect artifacts as evidence of their presence in their world. This tendency has been pervasive through all of human history. Determining what to save, how to save it and who has authority over it, is the essence of archival appraisal theory.</p>
<p>Computing has adopted this terminology of “archive“ for storing infrequently used content. Lots of interfaces provide the option to “archive“ content which moves it to cold storage.</p>
<p>Archives began as government records for storing information about the state. The goal of archiving was to understand the world better through retaining knowledge and and making it more broadly accessible. Modern day archival thought recognizes that any process of storing information contains subjectivity. Archives contain a specific summary of the past that are inherently incomplete. Some narratives will be documented and others will fade away. These acts of remembering and forgetting have a large influence on social identity.  The information we store and how we store has a large influence on our identity and understanding of the world. There has been a recent push to involve communities more in the archival process. Some archivists want to “decolonize“ the archive that was created by the government which has silenced certain voices.</p>
<p>There now also exists the personal archive. Technology companies are playing the role of archivist for lots of information. Archivists focus on storing information for relevance to narrative and legacy. Technology has often looked at storing information for later use and functionality.</p>
<p>The goal of this work is to expand archival theory to the world of computing.</p>
<h3 id="user-study">User Study</h3>
<p>The authors conducted a study of 17 adults. Participants ranged in age from 51 to 72. The only screening process was that participants considered themselves “older adults&quot;. The interview began with some easy personal questions and asked participants about what legacy meant to them. Then a series of questions was asked about the impact of forgetting.</p>
<p>The authors structured their results around three key questions</p>
<ol>
<li>What kinds of data should be kept?</li>
<li>How long should data be saved?</li>
<li>Who should decide what constitutes the archive?</li>
</ol>
<p>The authors found the following themes in their interviews</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants want documentation of the impact they had on the world.</li>
<li>None of the participants felt that their digital legacy accurately captured what they wanted their legacy to be.</li>
<li>Many of the participants highlighted how their legacy continues on in their descendants and the values they passed down to them.</li>
<li>Participants expressed wanting to forget things about negative relationships or experiences that they had. They wanted to forgot the negative experiences but not the person.</li>
<li>When thinking about information online most people reflected on things they consciously created and shared. They did not reflect on the passive user data that companies collect</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>From these interviews there appears to be a growing disconnect between how people think about personal archives and how digital companies store information. Not all data should be saved nor should it be saved forever. Some options are that people can dictate the duration of storage.</p>
<p>Building a personal archive is not only for the person though. It has impact on society. There is not always an easy binary between storing data or deleting.</p>
<p>Often archives are created by the powerful to protect and enhance their position in society. This shows it self in what data technology companies do and do not store. Tech companies try to stay neutral but there is nothing as neutral.</p>
<h2 id="my-closing-thoughts">My Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>This paper has one main point to make it. Tech companies are thinking about data storage in terms of usefulness. Data storage has a much larger impact then they realize. Data storage impacts narrative, identity and legacy. We should be cognizant of all the ways data storage impacts our society.</p>
<p>While the paper eventually gets to this point, it could have been made stronger and more clearly. This point has very large implications and I wish more time had been spent discussing those implications. After reading the paper, I absolutely agree with this main point but wish it had been expanded upon. If the paper was shorter and more focused, the message might have been stronger.</p>
<p>After reading the paper, I was somewhat confused about the role of the user interviews. They did not seem necessary to support the thesis. The interviews also were not about computing. I would be curious to hear the authors explanation for what they were aiming to get out of the interviews. If I had to guess, the interviews are included because personal stories are powerful. It is powerful to hear someone reflect on their own legacy and their place in the world. The user interviews are not evidence to support the thesis but rather a tool to make the reader reflect on the importance of legacy.</p>
<p>I really enjoy reading qualitative research papers. There is much more nuance when hearing from people in their own words and providing them with a save space to express themselves. Qualitative research is such a good way to discover unknowns. I find qualitative research provides the opportunity for surprises a lot more than strictly quantitative research. Qualitative research can often augment other types of research very successfully.</p>
<p>This paper forced me to reflect on how seemingly innocuous decisions can have large impacts. Gmail or FB were most likely not thinking about the impact they would have on legacy when deciding which data to archive. This highlights the importance of doing collaborative work with people who might see things from a different perspective. When companies have such a large influence it is important they bring in researchers who look at these problems from different perspectives.</p>
