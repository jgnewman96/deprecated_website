<p><a href="http://www.cunylawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/22-CUNYLR-382-Horan-Block_Tuttle-Newman.pdf">By Jessica Horan-Block &amp; Elizabeth Tuttle Newman</a></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>This paper by two attorneys at <a href="https://www.bronxdefenders.org/">Bronx Defenders</a> argues that quick, decisive, and aggressive action can return children to parents after abuse allegations much faster than traditional approaches. The authors outline how minority and low income parents are more frequently accused of abuse. Parents will bring their children to the Emergency Room in response to accidental injuries or strange physical developments. When the parents explanation for how the injury occurred is not deemed sufficient by the physician, they will be accused of abuse. For non-minority affluent families very rarely are the parents accused of abused. Instead the focus is on consoling them for their child&rsquo;s injury.</p>

<p>The author&rsquo;s argue that being separated from your parents and having to go through family court is dramatic for children and can hurt their development. Through early actions immediately after the abuse allegation, children&rsquo;s return to their parents can be expedited. A more traditional approach was to wait for a lot more information to be gathered before taking any action. Bronx defenders now takes the approach of putting the burden on the ACS (Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services) to prove that abuse was the most likely cause of the injury rather than waiting until later and having to prove that abuse was not likely. Even if this approach does not return the child to their parent it puts the parents in front of the court much sooner and the lawyers are able to learn what the case ACS is making against the parents.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>

<ul>
<li>The paper has many in depth examples about specific cases and how they were approached. Using specific examples is so helpful in illustrating their points and helps ground their arguments. All papers should use specific examples more. It is so important to be able to connect general theory with actual implementation.</li>
<li>It is very powerful that the authors show their learning process. Rather than just explaining their argument, they outline what their old approach was and how the new approach compares to it. This shows why they had previously taken another approach and how they transitioned to a new approach. This depiction of the learning process makes their arguments compelling.</li>
<li>I enjoyed how the paper was written directly to other practitioners. I have often read papers that seemed to be aimed at the void. Having a direct &amp; specific audience helps guide what are the important points and how can the information from this paper be incorporated by other individuals. Papers are not written just for the sake of knowledge but rather to share knowledge with others.Â  Writing to a specific audience can help direct the focus and direction of a paper.</li>
<li>The ACS, the children&rsquo;s parents, and the legal system should all have the best interests of the family in mind. Yet there are constant examples of where all of these groups are at odds. I was struck reading this paper by how distant the ACS seemed to be from the children and the families. This was truly an example of an outsider coming into a community and telling the community that it knows what is best for it. This is always a recipe for disaster and misalignment.</li>
</ul>
