    <div align="start" class="content">

<p>As another year passes I reflect on what I did over the past year and what I learned. Looking back it is tempting to focus on what has changed over the past year. It is tempting to compare where I am now and where I was a year ago. I have moved to a new city and started a new job. But comparing one year to another is so divorced from the actual experience of a year. Switching jobs was something that happened gradually over time. Moving cities was also a process that happened gradually over time. While there is a sharp discontinuity around each of these events, they were both actually long processes.</p>

<p>The best way for me to accurately sum up my year is too look back at the books I read. Doing this helps me remember what I was thinking about and what I learned. It allows me to see that my thinking trends in certain directions. That there are thoughts I return to. It gives me reference material that I can refer back to about a period of time in my life.</p>

<p>When I did this in 2018, I looked back through all my highlights and found the quotes that were the most meaningful. For 2019, it was mostly the same process. Once, I started this website though, I started writing about each book after I finished it and keeping track of the quotes. For the books I read towards the end of the year, you will see a link rather than the quotes directly below.</p>

<p>Having gone through this process, there are a couple of themes in my thinking that stick out.</p>

<hr />

<p>There were a couple of different topics I read about a lot. During the summer I read a fair amount about health. Through out the year I read quite a bit about race and how race impacts society. I also read a number of books about the environment and climate change. These are three different subjects that interest me a lot and I am excited to continue learning more about them.</p>

<p>The largest theme that seemed to purvey all that I read, is how everything is more complicated then we make it out to be. We are constantly trying to simplify and categorize things. The amount of randomness and information out there is so large, that we have to simplify it to get any understanding. It is in human nature to view things as binary rather than on a spectrum. We seek out clear boundaries rather than fuzziness. Telling attractive narratives  and not seeing randomness. It is a constant fight against our own nature to see the truth and not give in to oversimplifications.</p>

<p>We can objectively know all of this and still be susceptible to it. I have personally struggled a lot this year with the idea that I am insignificant. There is nothing special about me and that I am just one being. I find myself constantly yearning to be special, to be different. I have also been thinking about this on the macro level of the human race. What makes humans any more special than any other creature? We have defined our existence as being more important. But are our definitions correct? Would a different species not make different definitions?</p>

<p>Working through this question through out the year I have come to a place of some acceptance. While it will be something I continue to work through for a lifetime, I have come to a place that makes some sense to me. I am not special because of my skill at anything. I am not special because I am smart or because I particular excel at anything. I am special because of my own personal history and existence. No other person has the same history or experience as me. I am a unique individual that brings a different history and different perspective than anyone else. This is what makes me special. But it is also what makes all individuals special.</p>

<p>Previously, being special has meant differentiating myself from others. I am special if there is something that I am that other individuals are not. For me to be special, there most be other people who are normal. But this new meaning of being special does not require that distinction. It does not compare me to others. It understands that everyone is special. I am not special because I am in someway differentiated from others but rather recognizes the inherent uniqueness of an individual experience.</p>
