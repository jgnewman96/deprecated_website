    <div align="start" class="content"><p><strong>Seeing Like A State</strong> is one of professor James Scott&rsquo;s most well know pieces. It takes a comprehensive look at high modernism and why certain approaches to improve outcomes have failed. The book is centered on understanding what measures have been used to simplify very complex behavior. Through a few in depth case studies the book highlights how this simplified understanding can lead to bad outcomes. It is not that this simplification inherently leads to bad outcomes but when it is combined with the believe that you can do no wrong, it will often lead to those in power hurting others.</p>
<p>The core idea of this book is one of legibility. How does a state, take its populace and record information about the populace so that it can be understandable. One example of something that helps with legibility is a census. The census helps the state understand more about its population. Scott makes an argument against imperial planning and pushes us to recognize that there are many types of knowledge that exist outside of our traditional scope.</p>
<p>Some of Scott&rsquo;s arguments reminded me of the idea of bioregionalism from <a href="https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2020/do_nothing/">Jenny Odell</a>. There are things which are inherently local. We cannot understand everything from a higher level abstraction but only by becoming intimately aware with the most local context can we truly understand. It pushes us to recognize that as much as we like overall consistency and familiarity sometimes we must push ourselves to become more localized and more specific.</p>
<p>A common thread that Scott returns to is how measurement is a form of power. By measuring something you are implying that it matters and that the things you do not measure are less important. Scott often talks about how measurement gave the state more power and the ability to centralize more. That breaking things down into orderly measurable qualities is not always about actually improving conditions for people but rather makes things easier for the state to have control over.</p>
<p>Lots of the discussions in this book reminded me of this dichotomy of two different coaching styles. There is the coach who knows what his ideal team looks like. Regardless of who the players on the team are, he wants his team to play a certain style. He believes there are certain types of players who are going to be the most helpful. The other type of coach recognizes the team he currently has and tries to find a style that will work with that team. There is no ideal team or ideal style but what is going to work for that team is inherently local to the current players on the team. While it is possible for the coach who has an ideal team to be successful, I would always take the coach who works with what he has.</p>
<p>Overall this book was kind of challenging to read. Scott takes a really long time talking about each example. It is not clear that each example adds something new to his argument or expands our thinking. I appreciate how deeply he examines each situation and how much context he gives. I learned a lot about some different historical events that I did not know much about before. Scott&rsquo;s book challenges us to recognize how much we do not know and how dangerous simplification can be. He wants us to recognize different forms of knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>
<blockquote
    style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;  border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-left: 1px solid;">
    <p>
Some level of abstraction is necessary for virtually all forms of analysis, and it is not at all surprising that the abstractions of state officials should have reflected the paramount fiscal interests of their employer.

</blockquote>
<blockquote
    style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;  border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-left: 1px solid;">
    <p>
The farmer rarely experiences an average crop, an average rainfall, or an average price for his crops.

</blockquote>
<blockquote
    style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;  border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-left: 1px solid;">
    <p>
Officials of the modern state are, of necessity, at least one step—and often several steps—removed from the society they are charged with governing.

</blockquote>
<blockquote
    style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;  border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-left: 1px solid;">
    <p>
Although any ideology with a large altar dedicated to progress is bound to privilege the future, high modernism carries this to great lengths. The past is an impediment, a history that must be transcended; the present is the platform for launching plans for a better future.

</blockquote>
<blockquote
    style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;  border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-left: 1px solid;">
    <p>
Yet a man who uses an imaginary map, thinking that it is a true one, is likely to be worse off than someone with no map at all; for he will fail to inquire whenever he can, to observe every detail on his way, and to search continuously with all his senses and all his intelligence for indications of where he should go.
