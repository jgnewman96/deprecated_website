<p><em>Conversations with Friends</em> is the second book in the past month that I have read by Sally Rooney. Similarly to <a href="https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2020/normal_people/">Normal People</a>, this novel explores communication between people in romantic relationships. It highlights the dangers and destructive nature of expecting others to understand us. When we expect others to understand rather than communicating there will be failures. We make assumptions about how other people are processing events and get caught in the world inside our heads.</p>

<p><em>Conversations with Friends</em> is particularly concerned with internal representation versus external understanding. Francis&rsquo; actions are often perceived very differently then how she believes they will. Almost everyone believes that Francis is cold but she does not see herself that way. Characters constantly misinterpret each others actions and thoughts. This mismatch between internal view and external view blocks us from seeing how our actions impact others.</p>

<p>In both <em>Normal People</em> and <em>Conversations with Friends</em> Sally Rooney captures what college felt like for me. Life felt hectic and exciting. Situations change a lot from week to week. A lot feels out of your control. During college I struggled to be in touch with my own feelings. If I am not in touch with my own feelings it becomes that much more difficult to be aware of others.</p>

<p>I found reading both of Sally Rooney&rsquo;s books to be quite painful. It reminded me of college and how difficult that times was in a lot of ways. It reminded me of the times that I hurt other people and where things seemed to be spiraling out of control. It reminded me of being quite conflicted and not sure how to resolve anything. These books were painful because I am still so close to that period in my life. During my day to day now, that period can feel far away, but it is actually still quite close.</p>

<p>In some ways I am surprised how much people enjoy these two books by Sally Rooney. While they were meaningful reads, I am not sure how much I enjoyed them. I wonder if it was more difficult for me because I am still so close in age to the characters in the book. The further removed you are from their age the less you might identify with them and the easier it is to read? Maybe people enjoyed the book because of how difficult it was to read and how much it captured that difficulty.</p>

<p>Last thought: The letter from Melissa to Frances in the middle of the book was an absolute masterpiece. It was incredible. This book is worth the reading just for those few pages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Real writers, and also painters, had to keep on looking at the ugly things they had done for good. I hated that everything I did was so ugly, but also that I lacked the courage to confront how ugly it was.</p>

<p>I loved when he was available to me like this, when our relationship was like a Word document that we were writing and editing together, or a long private joke that nobody else could understand.</p>
