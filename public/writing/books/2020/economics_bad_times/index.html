    <div align="start" class="content">

<p>I have read a lot of &ldquo;pop&rdquo; science books and <em>Good Economics for Hard Times</em> is easily the best. Duflo and Banerjee explore very complex topics with nuance. They do an incredible job of conveying where there is uncertainty and what we know more definitively. Duflo and Banerjee both review the existing literature and expand upon potential future directions. <em>Good Economics for Hard Times</em> provides structure for thinking about complex problems like immigration or automation.</p>

<p>This book was so refreshing because Duflo and Banerjee were very honest about how economics has both helped and hurt the world. They highlighted how economists can often be over confident. They also explored the evidence behind trickle-down economics. Duflo and Banerjee explain that evidence for trickle-down economics is non-existent and that economic theory in isolation can lead to suboptimal Providing money to large organizations does not lead to everyone being more well off.</p>

<p>After reading this book I now recognize how most discussions about economics use economic theory and not economic empirical work. Theory without verification through concrete evidence means nothing. We need to stop prioritizing large organizations and acting like that will help everyone. We should not care as much about growth and GDP. GDP measures one thing but it does not accurately summarize a countries well being. We need to be more focused on all individual&rsquo;s quality of life. We need to care about the people in society who are struggling the most and try to directly help them.</p>

<p>While there has been a lot of talk about UBI and how that would help people, Banerjee and Duflo suggest that just giving people money is not enough. In the U.S. having a job is more than just a source of income. It provides people with community, purpose and a sense of empowerment. Duflo and Banerjee highlight the need to build communities and institutions. Instead of directly giving individuals money, we should expand a lot of services.</p>

<p>We should expand both elder care and head start programs. This would provide new jobs for lots of people and also be a much needed service. Money should be directed towards job retraining and helping people find jobs that they want to do. Industries are going to change and people&rsquo;s jobs are going to get automated. We should build a robust system of helping people find new jobs, new communities and new senses of purpose.</p>

<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The world is a sufficiently complicated and uncertain place that the most valuable thing economists have to share is often not their conclusion, but the path they took to reach it</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>The most important question we can usefully answer in rich countries is not how to make them grow even richer, but how to improve the quality of life of their average citizen.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>In a policy world that has mostly abandoned reason, if we do not intervene we risk becoming irrelevant, so let’s be clear. Tax cuts for the wealthy do not produce economic growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>But there are also so many market failures that it makes no sense either to rely on the market alone to allocate resources to the right use; we need an industrial policy designed that keeps in mind these political constraints.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>To demonstrate waste in government, one needs to show there is an alternative way of organizing the same activity that works better</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>Putting these families squarely on track toward productive work required more than money. It required treating them as human beings with a respect they were not used to, recognizing both their potential and the damage done to them by years of deprivation</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>The only recourse we have against bad ideas is to be vigilant, resist the seduction of the “obvious,” be skeptical of promised miracles, question the evidence, be patient with complexity and honest about what we know and what we can know.</p>
