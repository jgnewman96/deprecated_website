    <div align="start" class="content"><p><strong>The Memory Police</strong> By Yoko Ogawa is a very slow paced unnerving science-fiction novel. The novel takes place on an island where objects are slowly disappearing from people&rsquo;s memory. One day everyone wakes up and they no longer have the memory about a certain object. They proceed to destroy all instances of that object. This forgetfulness does not impact everyone on the island though. There are some people who do not forget. The memory police are a group on the island that enforces the disappearances and rounds up people who do not forget.</p>
<p>This book is a slow burn if I have ever read one. It felt so different from so many of the other books I read. I can often kind of predict what is going to happen in a novel or where it is going to go. With this novel I had trouble getting a read on the pacing or the direction. The narrator felt so removed and distant the entire time that it was so difficult to connect with anything in the book.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, this book felt like it was about what happens when we are not purposeful. If we are not purposeful things slowly drift away from us. We have to make a constant effort to make sure what we are doing has a purpose and that we are being thoughtful about our actions. This book took that to the extreme.</p>
<p>This book showcases how something can escalate without us thinking about it. At first just small things were disappearing and it did not seem like such a large deal. But then eventually books disappear and even human body parts disappear. By the end these larger disappearances did not seem like such a big deal though because we had built up to them.</p>

I knew somehow that she was too sad to cry—her tears were simply drops of liquid appearing of their own accord.

Even if they fade, something remains. Like tiny seeds that might germinate again if the rain falls.
