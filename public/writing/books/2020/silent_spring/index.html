    <div align="start" class="content">

<p><em>Silent Spring</em> is the environmentalist Rachel Carson&rsquo;s classic piece covering the dangers of pesticides. Carson explores the dangers of pesticides from so many different angles building up an intense amount of evidence of the dangers of pesticides. She highlights how harmful pesticides are to many different parts of our planet. The book is nothing if not repetitive show casing over and over again how we are doing damage to the planet with pesticides.</p>

<p>While Carson&rsquo;s book was written a while ago there are many lessons that can be learned from her writing and the situation with pesticides. Many parallels can be drawn between other ways we interact with our environment and how we use pesticides.</p>

<p>While reading this book, I was thinking a lot about the terms progressive and conservative. While both of these terms are very loaded because of the USA political system, we can think of them as simple terms. Progressives are people who are constantly wanting change, looking for opportunities to make things better. Conservatives are people who are scared of making things worse, they recognize that change is not always good and there are things that might have bad outcomes. When I was reading the book, some of my initial thoughts were about how it is important to have both types of people. We need the people who are excited about the next change and looking for how we can make things better. We also need people who are skeptical about these changes and will put them under intense scrutiny.</p>

<p>After a while, this kind of dichotomy made me feel uncomfortable. It seemed like an over simplification and that I was actually missing the point. It is not that there are always going to be both progressives and conservatives and we need them to balance each other out. Thats too convenient of a narrative that gives us an out. It says I can be a conservative because there will also be progressives or vice versa. Rather than relying on this idea of conservatives and progressives, what we learn from this book is that we all have to be more careful.</p>

<p>We should not aim to be conservatives or progressives. We should aim to be thoughtful and understand how little we know. We should look for opportunities to make improvements but also recognize that there is so much we cannot for see. There is so much conventional wisdom which was later shown to be false. We should be constantly pushing ourselves to think more objectively and understand what is going on. It is not about being a conservative or a progressive but having a greater understanding. If our pursuit is learning more and understanding more that will guide us in the right direction.</p>

<hr />

<p>Reading books provides an opportunity for me to learn from different mediums or people that I would otherwise learn from in my day to day. In my day to day I am regularly reaching about Machine Learning or Statistics. I am reading from software engineers and from people in the tech world. While in some respects that is quite a large world, in other respects it is actually quite narrow. Reading books provides me with that opportunity to learn from people outside of my career. Learning from this people often provides insights that I would not be able to obtain otherwise.</p>

<p>While it is not a perfect parallel let us compare the current hype with Artificial Intelligence with pesticides. People say that pesticides have a good use case and then started applying them everywhere. This is something similar to what has happened with AI. Business leaders want to use AI everywhere without a clear understanding of how AI works, where it is successful and where it is actually dangerous. We can learn so much by looking at other trends in other fields and should apply lessons from them.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are many different ways to make an argument. There are different ways to weave evidence and rhetoric together. In <em>Silent Spring</em> Rachel Carson makes such a compelling argument but hitting us on the head over and over again with evidence. If every piece of evidence has us update our beliefs a little bit, but the end of the book it is very difficult to belief that pesticides do not due an intense amount of damage.</p>

<p>This is an era of specialists, each of whom sees his own problem and is unaware of or intolerant of the larger frame into which it fits.</p>

<p>In the normal chemistry of the human body there is just such a disparity between cause and effect.</p>

<p>The trouble is that we are seldom aware of the protection afforded by natural enemies until it fails. Most of us walk unseeing through the world, unaware alike of its beauties, its wonders, and the strange and sometimes terrible intensity of the lives that are being lived about us</p>

<p>“Any science may be likened to a river,” says a Johns Hopkins biologist, Professor Carl P. Swanson. “It has its obscure and unpretentious beginning; its quiet stretches as well as its rapids; its periods of drought as well as of fullness. It gathers momentum with the work of many investigators and as it is fed by other streams of thought; it is deepened and broadened by the concepts and generalizations that are gradually evolved.”</p>
