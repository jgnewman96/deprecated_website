    <div align="start" class="content"><p>I have read Atul Gawande&rsquo;s writing in the New Yorker over the past year was quite impressed. He has a very measured tone and is very persuasive. <strong>Being Mortal</strong> was the only one of his books available at the library.</p>
<p>The best non-fiction books are those that combine stories with an analytical view. If it is only stories then often times the book is not making a larger point. Just an analytical argument can often miss the human side of a topic and can be a dry read. Gawande does a good job mixing a critic of current eldercare practices with stories about individual people. The most powerful part of the book is when Gawande talks about his own experience of his father passing.</p>
<p>The book does an incredible job of building up an argument. It begins by just looking at eldercare. It then takes that one step further to look at people with terminal illnesses. By the end we are thinking through larger questions about the purpose of life and how we want to structure our own.</p>
<p>This book hit me particularly hard because I was staying with my parents when I was reading it. As I get older, and my parents also get older, are relationship has continued to evolve. We have reached the tipping point where I am taking care of them more than they take care of me. When I go home I am often the one to do a lot of the cooking and cleaning. I am checking to make sure they are taking care of themselves. While my parents are still quite self-sufficient this book made me reflect on the process of them getting older and what that is going to look like. It made me think about how I can do a better job making sure that the rest of their years are really meaningful ones.</p>

<blockquote
    style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;  border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-left: 1px solid;">
    <p>
Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need

</blockquote>
<blockquote
    style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;  border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-left: 1px solid;">
    <p>
People with serious illness have priorities besides simply prolonging their lives. Surveys find that their top concerns include avoiding suffering, strengthening relationships with family and friends, being mentally aware, not being a burden on others, and achieving a sense that their life is complete

</blockquote>
<blockquote
    style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;  border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-left: 1px solid;">
    <p>
In other words, our decision making in medicine has failed so spectacularly that we have reached the point of actively inflicting harm on patients rather than confronting the subject of mortality

</blockquote>
<blockquote
    style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;  border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-left: 1px solid;">
    <p>
The pressure remains all in one direction, toward doing more, because the only mistake clinicians seem to fear is doing too little. Most have no appreciation that equally terrible mistakes are possible in the other direction—that doing too much could be no less devastating to a person’s life
