    <div align="start" class="content">

<p>I have read a book by Ta-Nehisi Coates each of the past two years. I read <em>Between the World and Me</em> two years ago and <em>We Were Eight Years In Power</em> last year. Both books demonstrated Coates impressive ability to forcefully convey powerful ideas. Coates is a masterful essayist. I listened to him and his editor Chris Jackson discuss <em>The Water Dancer</em> on the podcast <a href="https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-360-ta-nehisi-coates-and-chris-jackson">Longform</a>. I was quite excited to read Coates first novel and see how his writing style translated to a completely different medium.</p>

<p>One theme that stuck with me is how the past weighs on us. This theme was also present in another slave narrative I read, <a href="https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2019/washington_black/">Washington Black</a>. Hiram goes through immense difficulty transitioning from slavery to being free. He faces difficulty transitioning from living on the street to living in the house. As Hiram goes through life transitions his past and the tendencies he has built up weigh on him. Even though his situation has changed, he brings tendencies and feelings with him from his past. It is not easy to leave your history behind.</p>

<p>Reading previous slave narratives it is evident how difficult it was when families were divided. The teating apart of families due to the slave trade is often described. <em>The Water Dancer</em> highlights this difficultly but also a slightly different separation of families. A separation where some parts of the family have become free while others are still slaves. Even if you individually are free, it is difficult to feel that way when the people you love are still enslaved.</p>

<p>Growing up in the States today it can feel like slavery is far away from us. The civil war and slavery seem like a completely distant past. In both Coates non-fiction and this piece he reinforces that slavery is an integral part of who this country is. Slavery is not something that happened previously and we have moved past. Slavery will always be a part of our history. Just as individuals need to deal with their past, the U.S. needs to recognize that slavery is part of who we are. As individuals we all have baggage, and as a country we have baggage.</p>

<hr />

<p>The majority of pieces I read, whether fiction or non-fiction, are about someone great. They are about someone who is special. Rarely do I read a book that I feel speaks to just the common day to day experience of living a life. It does not speak to the small little moments. The writing regularly focuses on large events and people who are important.</p>

<p>I have experienced this a few times now where I am reading a novel and hoping that nothing special will happen. That the book will just be about someone who lives their life and goes through every day difficulty. But there always ends up being something extraordinary or special about the person&rsquo;s circumstances.</p>

<p>Books about ordinary people who live ordinary lives might not sell. It is also possible that if looked at in a certain way everyone&rsquo;s life is extraordinary and important. I am interested in exploring more how can the normalcy of the everyday be conveyed in a piece of literature that people will still enjoy. A piece of literature that focuses on the ordinary. On the everyday people living everyday lives rather than large events in special people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
