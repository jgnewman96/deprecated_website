<p><em>The Art of Learning</em> by Josh Waitzkin is a deep dive about how to reach the top of your field in any discipline. Josh was consistently one of the best chess players in his age group growing up. He discusses why he excelled at chess and the generalizable principles he learned. In his twenties Josh transitioned away from playing chess to studying Tai Chi. Josh became the world champion of Push Hands Tai Chi. Josh connects his mastery of chess to his study of Tai Chi.</p>

<p><em>The Art of Learning</em> talked about principles I had heard of before in greater detail. Josh discusses how to reach a mental state of high performance. He also explains how to get iteratively better at something and how to become more aware of your own faults. <em>The Art of Learning</em> is well worth the read just to see how someone at the top of two different fields thinks about improvement.</p>

<p>After reading the book I was reflecting on how to incorporate some of the lessons in the book into my own day to day. It feels like I will often read something, really enjoy it, feel like it has a lot of wisdom, and then just keep moving on. I think there are two problems with this way of looking at things. The first is that after reading a book, I will just be able to incorporate all of the information from it. Change takes a while and I will not be a different person all of a sudden. If I really want to take knowledge away from this book it will involve slowly incorporating some of its lessons. The other problem is that even if I am not directly implementing something from the book,  I might still have learned a lot from it. It is possible that some of the learnings from the book have gotten into my head and I will use them without even realizing it.</p>

<p><em>The Art of Learning</em> also made me think about how much I enjoy reading about someone who inspires me. Reading about people who we look up to inspires us and makes us feel like we could be great. We see people who inspire us are just normal people too. They worry about the same things as us and struggle with the same things as us.</p>

<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The key to pursuing excellence is to embrace an organic, long-term learning process, and not to live in a shell of static, safe mediocrity. Usually, growth comes at the expense of previous comfort or safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>The first mistake rarely proves disastrous, but the downward spiral of the second, third, and fourth error creates a devastating chain reaction..</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>The human mind defines things in relation to one anotherâ€”without light the notion of darkness would be unintelligible</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>In all disciplines, there are times when a performer is ready for action, and times when he or she is soft, in flux, broken-down or in a period of growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>We have to be able to do something slowly before we can have any hope of doing it correctly with speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>Not only do we have to be good at waiting, we have to love it. Because waiting is not waiting, it is life. Too many of us live without fully engaging our minds, waiting for that moment when our real lives begin.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>Once you know what good feels like, you can zero in on it, search it out regardless of the pursuit.</p>
