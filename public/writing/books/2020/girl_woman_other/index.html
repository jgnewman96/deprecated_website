    <div align="start" class="content">

<p><em>Girl, Woman, Other</em> by Bernardine Evaristo is a mix of a novel with a set of short stories. Each chapter is told from the perspective of a different women in England. Some of the stories are set in the present and some of them are set a hundred years ago. The stories cover a vast range of different experiences from people who grew up very poor to people who grew up with some wealth. It has stories about people in the country side and people in the city. Stories told from young perspectives and older perspectives.</p>

<p>While each story is its own entity, by putting all of them in one book and loosely tieing them together through a single event, the author has created a thread that ties all of them them. The reader can no loner read each story as it&rsquo;s own but is connecting it to the stories that come before it and come after it. The context of each story is all the other stories in the book.</p>

<p>Often a character will show up both in their own story but also in a story from someone elses perspective. By having characters switch between being narrators or being narrated about, we get different pictures of them. We see both how they think of themselves as well as how others think of them. This forces us to recognize that each character&rsquo;s narration is not completely reliable. We are confronted with this most dramatically with Carole and her teacher Mrs. King. Just as I never saw when I was going through school, Carole does not recognize that Mrs. King is also a person with hopes, dreams and fears. It is so easy for students to forget that teachers are just people too.</p>

<hr />

<p>Reading all of the stories in a row forced two opposite types of reflections in me. On one end it allowed me to see the similarities between all these different stories. All of the characters are struggling with acceptance, they struggle to find partners that empower them and struggle with loneliness. On the other end of the spectrum I reflected on how each of these stories was uniquely individual. While they might face similar fears, their situations are quite different and how they cope with them are quiet different.</p>

<p>It is easy to think of these reflections as opposites or incongruent with each other. Well what is it? Are they all different and unique or all they all the same? Well it is both! Everyone is struggling with loneliness and finding their place. But they all have a very unique context and the forms that loneliness take are very different for each of them. For some of the stories loneliness means having a partner that passed away. For some loneliness is not being understood by your parents and for others it is not being understood by your kids. What these means is that while loneliness might be something we all struggle with, it is going to manifest in a unique way for each individual.</p>

<p>Treating all loneliness as unique or all loneliness as the same is a losing battle. We can recognize that it takes unique forms but that it also has commonalties. Recognizing the commonalities allows us to learn from others and connect with that similarity in others. Recognizing the uniqueness allows us to not be overly prescriptive based on others experience and value that what everyone experiences is different.</p>

<hr />

<p>One commonality I noticed across the stories that forced a personal reflection was the damaging impact of having expectations for your partner. Wanting your partner to be your idealized version of a partner rather than accepting who your partner is. This aspect is most readily seen in the story of Dom and Nzinga, but it shows up in the other stories as well. We should not try and push our partners towards some idealized version of them. An idealized version of a person is a falsehood. Being a good partner is about listening, being open, honest and supportive.</p>

<p>If you want your partner to be some idealized version of a person they will always fail to meet your expectations.</p>

<p>Diab in Yazz’s room Yazz tells Waris it’s important to counterbalance the state of being cerebral with the state of being corporeal Waris asks her if she means they need to do physical activity because they spend too much time thinking? yes, that’s it, Yazz says, making elaborate movements with her arms as she dances why didn’t you just say that then?</p>
