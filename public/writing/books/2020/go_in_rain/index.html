<p><em>Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to a Tribe Called Quest</em> is a beautiful book. It blends a memoir, with a history of a rap group, with a history of a time period. While the book is ostensibly about the rap group, it actualls talks about so much more than one rap group. Abdurraqib writes a poetic style of prose that conveys so much emotion.</p>

<p>Abdurraqib writes through the lense of his personal experience with the group. He talks about how the groups music affected him and how he understood it in context of other music that was being made at a similar time. By displaying the emotional significance of the music, Abdurraqib is able to convey more about the group then just recounting facts. While Abdurraqib&rsquo;s account is inherently personal, it gives us insight into how the different group memebers were percieved and how they interacted with each other.</p>

<p>A Tribe Called Quest holds a particular place in my own heart. I had not heard of a Tribe Called Quest before I started listening to them in High School. There music straddeled two worlds where I was not a part of either. A lot of my friends where in the jazz band. I did not play an instrument and so when they would play together all I could do was listen. Another section of my friends was very into the new younger rappers that were putting out music at the time. While I would try to stay abreast of this music I would always hear the most recent music later than everyone else.</p>

<p>Finding and listening to A Tribe&rsquo;s music was an important part of forming an identity for me. It was something that I had found that no one else was listening. I did not find it because of my older brother or my parents. I did not find it because of my friends. It was something that I enjoyed because I personally had found it.</p>

<p>Similar to Abdurraqib, I also thought Phife Dawg was the star of the show and not Q-tip. I knew that Q-tip had a more illustrious solo career but I never understood why. I thought Phife&rsquo;s raps were better and enjoyed the sound of his voice more. When I look back at the celebrities / people I am attracted to, there seems to be a pattern. I always loved Russell Westbrook a lot more than I loved Kevin Durant. I am attracted to the little brother. The one who is trying to get out of the older brother&rsquo;s shadow. It may or may not have something to do with my own relation to my older brother :).</p>

<p>In highschool I loved to put on an album and listen to it all the way through on the way to or from school. Now, I almost never listen to albums. When I listen to music, I find a spotify playlist and listen to that. I rarely listen to exclusively one artist, let alone one album. While spotify and streaming music have made listening to music very convienent, I wonder if they not only change how we listen to music, but how music is created. Artists know that nobody listens to an album all the way through. Rather than trying to create a cohesive album, artists are focused on making good singles.</p>

<p>Here are some albums I have been listening to as I read this book.
- Monie Love: Down to Earth
- Queen Latifah: All Hail the Queen
- De La Soul
- Ice Cube: AmeriKKKa&rsquo;s Most Wanted
- Dr. Dre: The Chronic
- Outkast: Aquemini</p>

<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a shy and nervous kid, wracked with anxiety before I understood what anxiety was. I was desperate for a way to wear silence in a way that looked and felt cool to anyone in my presence.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>When there is nothing to point to as an excuse for distance, the distance looms larger, more difficult to push.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>The collective is, more that anything, a support system. Musically, yes. But beyond that, it is a grouping of friends telling each other that their ideas are valuable, that someone will believe in them, even if the people who believe in them are confined to the same studio, tinkering in all of the same weird ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Sampling created a dialogue between past and present and helped bridge a gap between the music a rapper was first introduced to and the music they desperately wanted to share with the new world</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m talking about what it is to be from a place that promises to love you while holding a gun to your neck. I’m talking about what it feels like to have the gun lowered, briefly, by the hands of some unseen grace. Sometimes, it is a protest that stretches long into a night, or sometimes it is a reading where a room hears familiar words and cries along with you as you read them out loud. But sometimes, it is a perfect album that arrives just in time to build a small community around you. To briefly hold a hand over your eyes and make a new and welcoming darkness of the world outside, even when it is on fire.</p>
