    <div align="start" class="content"><p>I was introduced to this book through <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a> and <a href="https://exponent.fm/">Exponent</a>. One of the co-hosts of Exponent, James Allworth, is a co-author of this book. While I have been reading Ben Thompson&rsquo;s (the author of Stratechery) writing for a couple years now, I knew a lot less about Allworth and his background. While James is a co-author of this book, the book is written from the perspective of Clayton Christensen. Christensen a professor at Harvard Business School, is best known for his work <em>The Innovator&rsquo;s Dillema</em>. This book focuses on taking theories from management consulting and applying them to your own life.</p>
<p>I welcome the approach of taking logic from the business world and using it to inspect your own life. Taking knowledge from one discipline and applying to another is often quite powerful. It makes clear the similarities between realms that we treat as separate. This cross pollination often provides a new perspective. I tried to take a similar approach <a href="https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/personal/politican_ideaology_leadership/">here</a> using interviews as a framing for thinking about picking a political candidate.</p>
<p>While there was so much that spoke to me in this book, I actually really struggled with it. I really enjoyed the focus on reflection and identifying what is important. But Christensen talks with such certainty about everything. He expresses certainty about his theories of business and that applying these theories to your life will turn out well. Living a happy and fulfilling live is immensely difficult. While Christensen&rsquo;s theories and frameworks might be helpful, they will not work for everyone.</p>
<p>The book also seems to neglect the aspect privilege plays in our ability to live fulfilling lives. It is a lot easier to focus on your purpose if you are not worrying about feeding your children. While the theories Christensen provides might be useful to people in all scenarios, it is easier for people who go to Harvard Business School to apply them, then people who never had the opportunity to attend college.</p>
<p>I personally struggled with Christensen&rsquo;s focus on religion and the role it played in his life. While religion will play a powerful role in many lives it is not for everyone. I wish the book had not just been written from his point of view but all three of the authors. This would have given insight into how different people with different perspectives apply the same theory. By only being from Christensen&rsquo;s point of view, it diminished how accessible some of the theories felt.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to probe whether you can trust the advice that a theory is offering you is to look for anomalies—something that the theory cannot explain.</p>
