    <div align="start" class="content"><p><em>The Color of Law</em> By Richard Rothstein provides an extensive history of discrimination in housing policy in the United States. Rothstein chronicles discrimination at all levels of government and in all facets of housing. Whether it is discrimination through zoning, mortgages or schools, different levels of government continued to find new ways to enforce segregation. Rothstein refutes that housing segregation is a result of people&rsquo;s preferences. He shows that housing segregation is a direct result of governmental policies that still impact our country today.</p>
<p>Rothstein argues that the government is constitutionally obligated to provide amends for the ways it has  hurt African Americans through housing policy. Since the government has broken the constitution, it is required to repay victims for the damages it has done. Rothstein makes a case for reparations purely from a legal standpoint of what the United States constitution requires.</p>
<p>Reading this book highlights how we need to understand our history to understand the present moment. Most of the legislation and actions he talks about happened before I was born and a lot of it took place before even my parents were born. Yet these actions are still having serious consequences on our society today. If you only viewed housing segregation in the present you might reach the conclusion that Rothstein refutes; housing segregation is a result of individuals preferences.</p>
<p>While it is possible to dispute some of the individual points that Rothstein makes, the entire book is difficult to refute. You might be able to proof that certain policies do not have the impact he lays out. But as a whole when presented with this evidence, it is impossible to argue that the government did not support and implement housing segregation.</p>
<p>I appreciated Rothstein&rsquo;s sentiments at the end of the book about how to think through next steps. Often we want a quick solution, or a quick calculation of damages. We want a solution that is a win for all people. Rothstein is direct and honest. Fixing this problem is not going to be a win for all. Some people have thoroughly benefitted from housing segregation and addressing the damages that were caused will potentially hurt some people. Rothstein highlights that since government policy is what caused housing segregation it should also be able to solve it. He makes the point that there will not be a perfect policy that solves everything but we have to start somewhere and the government must start trying to fix the wrongs they have committed.</p>
<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There is generally no judicial remedy for a policy that the Supreme Court wrongheadedly approved. But this does not mean that there is no constitutionally required remedy for such violations</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>“Let bygones be bygones” is not a legitimate approach if we wish to call ourselves a constitutional democracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Ending segregation in housing, however, is much more complicated. Prohibiting discrimination in voting and restaurants mostly requires modifying future behavior. But ending de jure segregation of housing requires undoing past actions that may seem irreversible</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>REMEDIES THAT can undo nearly a century of de jure residential segregation will have to be both complex and imprecise. After so much time, we can no longer provide adequate justice to the descendants of those whose constitutional rights were violated. Our focus can be only to develop policies that promote an integrated society, understanding that it will be impossible to fully untangle the web of inequality that we’ve woven.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>With very rare exceptions, textbook after textbook adopts the same mythology. If middle and high school students are being taught a false history, is it any wonder that they come to believe that African Americans are segregated only because they don’t want to marry or because they prefer to live only among themselves?</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>But we delude ourselves if we think that desegregation can only be a win-win experience for all. There are costs involved, and some may be substantial</p>
