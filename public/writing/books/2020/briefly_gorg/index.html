    <div align="start" class="content"><p><em>On Earth We&rsquo;re Briefly Gorgeous</em> By Ocean Vuong is a novel from the perspective of a narrator writing to his mother. The narrator recounts many different stories from his childhood and his relationship with different influences in his life. The letter jumps all over the place recounting stories about his Grandma&rsquo;s life, to segments from the narrators point of view now that he is an adult.</p>
<p>This book reminded me in a lot of ways of some passages in <a href="https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2020/severance/">Severance</a>. The narrator is trying to imagine what it might have been like for his mother or grandmother being an immigrant and raising him. He tries to connect with his mother in different ways but also thoroughly resents his mom. The existence that his mom knows is so different from his own and he struggles to connect with her.</p>
<p>While the book was written as a letter to his mom, and the narrator&rsquo;s mom underlies the entire story, the vocal point of the story to me was Trevor. Trevor was the narrator&rsquo;s first lover and the only character we learn about who is not in the narrator&rsquo;s family. Trevor clearly had an immense amount of influence on the narrator. It felt as though the narrator was potentially writing this letter for Trevor rather than for his Mom.</p>
<p>It was interesting to intuit how the narrators view of himself changed over the time. The format of the narrative led to discussion of other characters rather than the narrator. The narration was very light on the narrator&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings. We are left to understand them from what the narrator says about others. It was fascinating to see how the narrator begin to take more active roles in the stories he told as he got older.</p>
<p>The part of the book that was the most powerful to me was how well it captured the feel of certain places. The book could have been a letter to Hartford as much as it was a letter to his mom. The narrator did such a good job conveying the feeling of different places during different time periods.</p>
