<p><em>Exhalation</em> by Ted Chiang is a set of short stories that really showcases some of what I love about sci-fi. Chiang uses each story to explore our contemporary culture in a way that is only possible through sci-fi. Good science fiction is not writing about a different. It is writing about our own society and using other places to provide a context that would not be possible otherwise. By looking at and asking questions about what the world would look like in other scenarios we can better understand our own world.</p>

<p>Almost every story in this set is actually incredible. In each story Chaing showcases a different writing style and a different angle. Some of the stories are long and really suck you into the world and some are short and leave you with an uneasy feeling. Each one forces you to reflect more on your own existence and put it in context of other types of existence.</p>

<hr />

<p>Often really good sci-fi is driven by a couple of key concepts. There is one idea that the writer wants to explore and that exploration drives the entire novel. In the first story in this set Chiang explores what time travel would look like if we could not actually change the past or the future. In another story Chiang explores the idea of cultivating artificial intelligence over a very long time period. Sci-fi stories are often driven by one key idea. This does not only show up in Chiang&rsquo;s writing but other famous stories as well. In <em>Snow Crash</em> by Neal Stephenson there are a couple of key ideas that drive the majority of the plot. <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> is another novel that is really driven by a couple of key concepts.</p>

<p>While I loved the stories in Exhalation there were ways it was limited by being short stories. I know that not every story needs to do everything. Especially with short stories, there is only so much you can do in a story. But Chiang&rsquo;s story were missing some depth in their characters. The ideas that Chiang was exploring all seemed to be driven by a voice of god narrator. The exploration was not through characters changing and interacting with their surroundings as much.</p>

<p>I wonder if having a story driven by one or a couple of key ideas leads to authors neglecting other parts of a good story. My favorite sci-fi writing is that of Ursula Le Guin because she does not give up character depth. She is able to maintain characters that change and are complex while still having key ideas that drive the novel. If you have not read <em>Left Hand of Darkness</em> I highly recommend checking it out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But in truth the source of life is a difference in air pressure, the flow of air from spaces where it is thick to those where it is thin</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretend that you have free will. It’s essential that you behave as if your decisions matter, even though you know they don’t. The reality isn’t important; what’s important is your belief, and believing the lie is the only way to avoid a waking coma. Civilization now depends on self-deception. Perhaps it always has.</p>

<p>They’re blind to a simple truth: complex minds can’t develop on their own &hellip; For a mind to even approach its full potential, it needs cultivation by other minds.</p>

<p>if you want to create the common sense that comes from twenty years of being in the world, you need to devote twenty years to the task.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In most cases we have to forget a little bit before we can forgive; when we no longer experience the pain as fresh, the insult is easier to forgive, which in turn makes it less memorable, and so on. It’s this psychological feedback loop that makes initially infuriating offenses seem pardonable in the mirror of hindsight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People are made of stories. Our memories are not the impartial accumulation of every second we’ve lived; they’re the narrative that we assembled out of selected moments.</p>

<p>Instead I will say that it’s easier for me to appreciate the benefits of literacy and harder to recognize everything it has cost us.</p>
