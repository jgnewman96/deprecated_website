    <div align="start" class="content">

<p><em>Normal People</em> by Sally Rooney is one of my most anticipated books in the past couple of years. I had heard from many different sources about how good this book is. Family, friends and numerous co-workers all recommended it highly. It is relatively rare that I hear praise about a book from so many different sources.</p>

<p>I can see why so many different people enjoyed Rooney&rsquo;s writing. She does an incredible job portraying emotion and what it feels like to be in your late teens / early twenties. The book captures how certain moments take on such intense significance. Her writing portrays social anxieties that I could not have put into words.</p>

<p>Personally, I found the novel to be intensely painful. It was difficult to see Connell and Marianne repeatedly  hurt each other. Numerous times they had large misunderstandings. They would either make an assumptions about what the other person was thinking or they would assume that the other person knew what they were thinking.</p>

<p>One particularly powerful aspect of the book was how Marianne and Connell&rsquo;s relationship changed over time. The reader is able to experience the characters growing and changing together. We even see their internal monologues develop and taken on more nuance as they get older. They improve their communication and make more of an effort to understand the other person. Rooney&rsquo;s portrayal of learning more about relationships and how to communicate with another person as we get older felt spot on.</p>

<p>Rooney is able to capture small moments or feelings through metaphor. Quite a few of my favorite quotes from the book are her capturing a feeling through a metaphor.</p>

<hr />

<p>This book continued my trend of thinking about trauma and how it stays with us. For both Connell and Marianne as they grow trauma from earlier stays with them. They each have deeply engrained feelings that do not go away. These long formed deep feelings formed impact their ability to be good partners for each other.</p>

<p>It is also furthered my thinking on the idea of pivotal moments. This book reminded me that earlier in my life it did feel like there were these intense significant moments. That what happened in the next hour or day was going to have a huge impact on my life. Is that how life actually happens at a certain age? Or just how it is perceived? Even though months would often pass in between each chapter, we could essentially predict where the next chapter would begin. Does each pivotal moment set our trajectory until the next pivotal moment changes it? As we get older are there less of these pivotal moments or does our interpretation of them change?</p>

<p>I’m just nervous, he says. I feel like it’s pretty obvious I don’t want you to leave. In a tiny voice she says: I don’t find it obvious what you want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From a young age her life has been abnormal, she knows that. But so much is covered over in time now, the way leaves fall and cover a piece of earth, and eventually mingle with the soil. Things that happened to her then are buried in the earth of her body. She tries to be a good person. But deep down she knows she is a bad person, corrupted, wrong, and all her efforts to be right, to have the right opinions, to say the right things, these efforts only disguise what is buried inside her, the evil part of herself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>All these years they’ve been like two little plants sharing the same plot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions.</p>
