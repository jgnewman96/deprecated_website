    <div align="start" class="content"><p><strong>Stories of Your Life and Others</strong> is a book of science fiction short stories by Ted Chiang. Chiang is one of my favorite writers. I love the way he brings real science into his science fiction. He is not writing about completely fictional worlds. He uses science fiction to force us to think about our own world and our own science in a different way.</p>
<p>This book is for sure weaker than his other book of short stories <a href="https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2020/exhalation/">Exhalation</a>. Similar to Exhalation, the end of the book contains a short note explain the genesis of each story. Chiang&rsquo;s still seems to be that each story has one core idea that drives it. After he has an idea that is driving the story he then crafts a narrative that allows the reader to explore that idea in a nuanced way.</p>
<p><strong>The Story of You&rsquo;re Life</strong> is the most well known story in this collection. It is the basis for the movie Arrival. Even though I had seen the movie Arrival before, this story was still breathtaking. The ways it explores language, time and how we perceive the world is so incredible. One of the things I also love about this story is that it does not drop us into the middle of this different perspective immediately. Rather we see how the narrator slowly discovers this shift in perspective and how it changes her. It would have been easy to just drop us into the mind of one of the heptapods, but this direction felt a lot more powerful.</p>
<p>I also really enjoyed the story questioning our ideas of beauty. Telling the story from many different perspectives was quite powerful and I loved seeing the thought experiment about how society would respond. Some of Chiang&rsquo;s stories are deeply intimate at the individual level, this one is more a society level view. Its very impressive that he can write both types of stories.</p>

Two figures might appear at opposite ends of the tablet, though they stood side by side on the surface of the cylinder.

Explain it by saying that a difference in the index of refraction caused the light to change direction, and one saw the world as humans saw it. Explain it by saying that light minimized the time needed to travel to its destination, and one saw the world as the heptapods saw it. Two very different interpretations.

Are we more fully realized when we minimize the physical part of our natures? And that, you have to agree, is a profound question.
