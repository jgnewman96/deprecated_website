    <div align="start" class="content"><p><strong>The Color Purple</strong> has been my list since I went to a meditation retreat earlier this year led by <a href="https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/talks/mindfulness/med_social_rhonda/">Rhonda Magee</a>. She highly recommended reading this novel and remarked a number of times about how powerful it is.</p>
<p>The Color Purple touches on a couple of deep and complex subjects in a short space. It conveys emotions on these subjects in a different way because it is a piece of fiction. Fiction can be read at a distance, where as non-fiction forces direct reference on the world we live. This distance provides the reader with more room for reflection. The novel is tied together by letters written by two sisters, Celie and Nettie.</p>
<p>The story shows how surroundings, particularly one&rsquo;s immediate community impacts development. Every character is immensely influenced by their immediate surroundings. We see the juxtaposition of Nettie and Cellie who are sisters but move through the world in very different ways. Because of Cellie&rsquo;s relationship to their father she is provided with a different set of opportunities than Nettie. This leads to Cellie and Nettie being on different continents and developing in different environments. We also see the differences in Cellie before and after Shug Avery has come into her life.</p>
<p>The Characters development overtime and their ability to change is quite powerful. We first see this with Cellie and how she takes more control over her life and is more in touch with her wants through her interactions with Shug. We also see a drastic change in Albert after Cellie and Shug leave him. For Cellie the change was brought through someone new entering her life, but for Albert it was from people leaving their life.</p>
<p>The passage where Cellie and Shug Avery talk about their relationship to God and their relationship to the Church is a particularly powerful one. Shug helps Cellie start to question truths she has accepted her entire life. It is powerful to see Cellie come to a new understanding and for her concept of God to be re-oriented.</p>
<p>I have not fully processed how to think about the Nettie story line and everything that happens to her in Africa. The story touches heavily on aspects of colonialism and working with communities that are vastly different from your own. It also puts a magnifying class to the difference of being Black in the United States to being Black in Africa.</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading <strong>The Color Purple</strong>. Different readers will find different characters or story lines that they connect to. The novel forced me to reflect on how perception of events rather than events themselves can often play a big role in our experience. I am excited to read more of Alice Walker&rsquo;s work.</p>

There is so much we don’t understand. And so much unhappiness comes because of that

There’s something in all of us that wants a medal for what we have done. That wants to be appreciated. And Africans certainly don’t deal in medals. They hardly seem to care whether missionaries exist
