<p><em>My Year of Rest and Relaxation</em> by Otessa Moshfegh is quite a trip. The reader is taken inside the mind of a young adult living in New York who is trying to sleep for a entire year. The main character&rsquo;s parents died and she recently left her job. She is using medication to sleep as much as possible. She hopes that after a year of sleeping she will be able to have a new start and be divorced from the darkness of her previous life.</p>

<p>The book is dark, biting, and very funny at times. The book reminded me how complicated everyone&rsquo;s internal monologue can be. I am so often wrapped up in my internal monologue that I forget everyone around me is having an equally complicated one at the same time.</p>

<p>The book also made me think about how easy it is for people to feel lonely and fall through the cracks post college. Up until college everyone has a strong support system with people all around them. Post college that can change a lot. There is no one checking up on you or looking out for you in the same way.</p>

<p>But I was terrified. It was lunacy, this idea, that I could sleep myself into a new life. Preposterous. But there</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The notion of my future suddenly snapped into focus: it didn’t exist yet. I was making it, standing there, breathing, fixing the air around my body with stillness, trying to capture something—a thought, I guess—as though such a thing were possible, as though I believed in the delusion described in those paintings—that time could be contained, held captive. I didn’t know what was true.</p>
