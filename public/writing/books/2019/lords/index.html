    <div align="start" class="content"><p><em>Lords of the Realm</em> by John Helyar chronicles the history of baseball through the eyes of the owners.  We generally learn about the history of sports through the great players and their influence on the game. This book looks at the owners and how they shaped the game of baseball as it developed. The book is particularly focused on the labor relations between the players and the owners.</p>
<p>This book showed a completely different side of baseball history than I am used to. I have heard about all the great players, but never learned about how free agency developed. I did not know how farm systems developed or how expansion took place. Before reading this book I rarely gave the owners much thought. I did not consider how they shaped the game and how different sports have different models of free agency.</p>
<p>While reading <em>Lords of the Realm</em> I reflected on how the process of change is slow and how trying to change everything at once can actually be counter productive. It is important to take the long run view of change. Do not set your sights on getting everything accomplished in one go. A really powerful tactic can be to ask yourself where you want to be in a couple of years and then set smaller steps that are necessary to get there.</p>
<p>I also reflected on the economics of Baseball a fair amount and how there are more general principles we that can be applied to other scenarios. For Baseball teams there is a competitive balance problem. It took a very long time, but the owners recognized the need for wealth redistribution. They recognized that largest markets will do a lot better than teams in the smallest markets. For the good of the entire game it is important that all teams are thriving. To me this sounds a lot like general problems that we have with inequality in society. We can accept that redistribution of wealth should happen for baseball teams, but it is still very difficult to accept at a personal level.</p>
<p>I am interested in exploring sports contracts and how market dynamics are in play for players contracts in more depth at a later date. The sports market provides a lot of interesting principles that can be studied and then applied more generally. I am specifically interested in some of the more unique principles that different sports have put in to play and the impact they have. I would be interested in exploring the salary cap in Basketball and the franchise tag in Football.</p>

<p>If they were united, there was nothing they could not do. He used the same words over and over: “Together you are irreplaceable.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“The owners themselves were responsible for it working so badly. What happened was that baseball wasn’t governed by supply and demand. The owners wanted to win so badly they didn’t care about breaking even. They always thought, ‘We’re just one player away.’ ”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But he did think he had to start doing what Miller had once done so brilliantly: look a few negotiations out, decide where he wanted to go, and try to get there a bit at a time. He probably couldn’t get as much “meaningful</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If the game is lost to the economics that drives it, then we’ll lose the humanity that is unique to the game. We all must feel it and live it in our way and be mindful of its vulnerability to abuse.</p>
