    <div align="start" class="content"><p><em>One of my friends and teammates asked me for some feedback about what he should be working on during the frisbee off-season. I wrote him an email explaining about how I think about getting better in the off-season before sending him some personal feedback. I thought sending this email would help contextualize how I think about getting better and reaching our goals. Some of the information in here, can be applied to really any skill, not just getting better at frisbee. The full email is below</em></p>

<p>Hey Ben,</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts about training during the off-season and making a comprehensive plan: </p>

<p>I have noticed that a lot of players struggle to continue getting better after college. I believe a large portion of that is because players get better in college through a largely passive effort. In college you are playing so much frisbee all the time, that you are naturally going to get a ton better. After college though you end up playing a fair amount less and that makes it harder to keep getting better in the same way. I also think its because the way you grow that extra 10-20% is a lot different then the way you grow the first 80%. Growing that last 10-20% is a lot harder. But it is what separates the good players from the ones who are really great. </p>

<p>Now that we have hit the offseason it is an opportunity to re-focus and really dial in on how we want to improve and the steps to make that happen. For both of us, I think we want to use the off-season as an opportunity to improve a lot. Using the off-season to improve can be a lot harder then using the season. We are not getting as many reps against high level competition as we did during the season. This means that getting better during the off-season requires a different approach. We have to be more concentrated in how we want to get better. I believe it is necessary to make an off-season plan. If we just go into the off season abstractly saying we want to get better, nothing will come off that. </p>

<p>It is important to identify specifically how we want to improve, and then make a plan for how to get there. Let us start off with a goal. I think for both of us, a goal would be to make Revolver next year. </p>

<p>Now that we have our goal let us break it down a little bit more. We want to be good enough to make Revolver. But what does that actually mean? How do we become good enough to be on Revolver. There are a lot of different players who are on Revolver who are good at different things. </p>

<p>There are two parts of it. We have to understand who we are as players and then how that could fit in with a team like Revolver. One huge part of this is getting feedback from others. You do a really good job of this. You are constantly seeking feedback from others. While we might have an understanding of who we are as a player, what our strengths and weaknesses are, others can help provide more perspective. </p>

<p>The other thing I want to call out, is most people think about getting better in terms of minimizing their weaknesses. While minimizing your weaknesses is good, there are plenty of high level players with weaknesses. What sets high-level players apart is that they have one strength that is just so good. Not everyone on a team needs to be able to do everything well. But if you can do one thing better than everyone else on the team, you probably have a spot on that team. </p>

<p>Once we have identified what are the skills we want to work on and what is our personal path to making the team that we want to, we have to make a plan to get there. This is the part to me where we have to start thinking on small time scales. It is impossible for us to think about actions we take over the entire off season. Instead we have to think about what are we doing this week. What are we doing this week to reach our goals. </p>

<p>For example, if I want to be a shut down handler defender, what I am doing this week and how does that contribute to the goal. Is it that I am doing some lifts to increase my athleticism. Is it that I am doing some footwork drills to improve my change of direction. Is it that I am watching film of other good defenders to learn what they do. When we break our goals down into weekly plans, then they become something we can actually reach. We then know, are we doing enough every week to reach our goals. </p>

<p>There are three more points I want to touch on: </p>

<ul>
<li>I believe one of the best ways to get better is to learn from others. That does not necessarily mean someone who is a better player than you, but it is pivotal to find people you can learn from.  Often the best way to do this is to work out with players from the team you want to make. Surrounding yourselves with people you can learn from is very important. </li>
<li>I also believe that there are mental skills that people can work that most people do not think about. Mental skills are what separate the truly best players. Having a strong mental game is what determines your consistency of play and your ability to learn from your mistakes. Everyone should put more time into working on their mental game. We can talk more about what that looks like if you are interested. It is probably its own long soliloquy. </li>
<li>It is easier to do anything when you have a community supporting you. It is easier to wake up early in the morning to work out when you are going to see your friends. It is more fun to run sprints when you are doing it with people you care about. Working hard to get better is more meaningful when you do it with other people. Set up a community this off-season that will help you get better and reach your goals. </li>
</ul>

<p>Let me know your thoughts on all of this. I am pretty amped about this off-season and excited to work on getting better. It is huge to me that I am in a place where I will be able to play year round.</p>
