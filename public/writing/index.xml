      <description>By Paul H. Garthwaite, Joseph B. Kadane and Anthony O’Hagan
Summary This paper is an overview of how to take experts believes and turn them into statistical distributions. It combines a long line of psychology research with statistics research. The situation we are examining is when we want to create a distribution over a value from an experts opinion. It is impossible to ask an expert to give us a probability distribution so we need a methodology to query an expert that allows us to create the distribution ourselves.</description>

      <title>2019 in Review: The Books I Read</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/year_review_2019/</link>

      <description>As another year passes I reflect on what I did over the past year and what I learned. Looking back it is tempting to focus on what has changed over the past year. It is tempting to compare where I am now and where I was a year ago. I have moved to a new city and started a new job. But comparing one year to another is so divorced from the actual experience of a year.</description>

      <description>There Eyes Were Watching God is a novel about Janie, an African American Women born shortly after the end of slavery. The novel follows her she moves through three different husbands and living situations. This book is the most well known piece of literature by Zora Neale Hurston. The book is often read in English classes in either high school or college. I never read There Eyes Were Watching God in school; I was in the other 10th grade english class.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2019/lords/</guid>
      <description>Lords of the Realm by John Helyar chronicles the history of baseball through the eyes of the owners. We generally learn about the history of sports through the great players and their influence on the game. This book looks at the owners and how they shaped the game of baseball as it developed. The book is particularly focused on the labor relations between the players and the owners.
This book showed a completely different side of baseball history than I am used to.</description>

      <description>In the past year there has been a large focus on what is wrong with the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Coverage has focused on limitations of current deep learning and machine learning systems. Pieces have highlighted the dangers of implementing systems without understanding their implications or who they are going to impact. These pieces have highlighted areas where these fields need to grow. Machine Learning is still a relatively young field that needs to grow and learn.</description>

      <description>Jenny, my wonderful partner in crime and teammate, had her birthday last month. I got her a Nintendo Switch, with the game Overcooked. Overcooked is a cooking simulation game. You are in a kitchen with other chefs and you have to collaborate to make customers dishes. While simple in concept, Overcooked is quite deep in how it forces you to work together. The levels are set up so that the only way you can succeed is by delegating and working together.</description>

      <description>My Year of Rest and Relaxation by Otessa Moshfegh is quite a trip. The reader is taken inside the mind of a young adult living in New York who is trying to sleep for a entire year. The main character&amp;rsquo;s parents died and she recently left her job. She is using medication to sleep as much as possible. She hopes that after a year of sleeping she will be able to have a new start and be divorced from the darkness of her previous life.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2019/creativity/</guid>
      <description>Creativity Inc was a fantastic book looking at the culture of Pixar. It explained the founding of Pixar and how the founders maintain an intense focus on developing a fantastic culture. The founders believe that if they maintain a good culture, their business will thrive. A successful business is not about having a great product plan, but developing a good culture and empowering smart people.
I appreciated that the book did not prescribe easy solutions but discussed everything with nuance.</description>

      <description>Washington Black by Esi Edugyan was quite an enjoyable piece of historical fiction. Here are a couple of different themes that personally stuck out to me.
Science as an equalizer The book played around a couple of different times with the idea that science and viewing the world through a scientific lens is an equalizer. That if you viewed the world through a scientific lens then you would not discriminate against certain people and you would be better able to see the truth.</description>

      <description>Why I am leaving Nielsen Nielsen was my first experience working at a full time job and in a lot of ways it was a good one. I learned an immense amount and became a much better data scientist. I met a lot of very smart people who helped me grow and taught me a lot. There were a lot of frustrations though during my time at Nielsen and I thought it would be worthwhile to expand upon why I am leaving.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2019/omnivore/</guid>
      <description>The Omnivore&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma by Michael Pollan was an absolutely fascinating read. I enjoyed learning more about our food insutry and how the human food chain has developed. The central question of the book was where does our food come from? What seems like such a simple question has become quite complex in our modern society. I learned a lot by watching Michael try to answer this question.
 While this book dealt explicitly with our food chain, it raises a lot of questions about the complexity of our society today.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Dominik Moritz at Apple/CMU and Kanit &amp;ldquo;Ham&amp;rdquo; Wongsuphasawat at Apple
Motivation So what is declarative data visualization? As programmers we are used to imperative programming. Imperative programming is specifying how to do a problem. For example you say, put a red circle here and put a blue circle there. It couples the specification with the execution. In declarative programming we only specify what should be done. We would say map x and y to specific position, not how to max x and y.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Josh Tobin works at Open Ai and Full stack Deep Learning. Talk Resources
Motivation Troubleshooting neurel nets is hardest part of building a deep model. Even the best practitioners spend a long time trouble shooting. Josh argues that the vast majority of what the best practitioners do to troubleshoot their models can be broken down to a decision tree. During this talk he presents that decision tree.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Jason Yosinski. He works at Uber AI Labs and Recursion Pharmaceuticals
Motivation We train and use neural netwroks but we have a very minimal grasp on how they actual work. We have created systems that can beat humans players in games and actually create robots that can work. We have made huge advances in creating systems that can do impressive things. Most of the this improve has been driven by increase in computation and increase in amounts of data.</description>

      <description>I read this book because of a recommendation from my friend Hawkins. I had previously read a couple of other books by Ursula Le Guin. I absolutely loved both Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed. Both were sci-fi books that were actually commentaries on human society. I cannot get enough of books like that. Hawk had mentioned that this book was about a communist society and what that would look like.</description>

Motivation Climate change as an important issues does not need that much motivation. We have all seen what has been happening California recently with the wild fires. There has been increasingly severe impacts from human influence on our climate system.
One thing that is important to recognize about climate change is that different parts of the world are impacted differently.</description>

Motivation What most practitioners of deep learning do is train models. Training models that do something is the easy part. The hard part is actually evaluating and testing those models. Most people evaluate their models by tieing them to a certain set of data and seeing the accuracy on that data. This has problem because it is tied to a given set of data and the potential problems with that data.</description>

What is Machine Learning? The talk started by Professor Jordan defining what Machine Learning is. He said that machine learning is not some new field of research but it is rather the engineering extension of statistics. He calls back to how there was chemistry for a long time before there was chemical engineering. There was physics and electrical theory before there was electrical engineering.</description>

This talk was about a new area of Deep Learning research that is still very much theory. In this approach rather than specifying the architecture of a given model, the data tells us the structure of our model. This approach provides for new notation and new conceptual ways for us to think about deep learning.</description>

Motivation Machine learning development is complex. This is not due to the underlying theory but rather all of the different stages in development. Each stage has its own requirements and goals. We have developed tools and best practices for this for traditional software development, but not Machine Learning.
Here are the differences between traditional software and machine learning

Motivation Even if we build the most incredible thing, if it is not designed with users in mind, no body will use it. If we have built something that nobody will use, is it even incredible. If nobody is using what we have built than that is a failing.
We can build tools that users actually care about and will use if we take a user-centered design approach.</description>

Motivation Boris motivated the need for visual techniques with an example on the Iris data set. He showed three different models for the Iris data set, shown below.
He highlighted that the problem with each of these analytical approaches is that they generalize to areas we have seen before. Ideally, instead we would have a model that classified points in space we had seen before and refused to classify points in the unknown space.</description>

      <description>My friend Hawkins recently sent me the following question:
 How do you work around biased data sets to produce non discriminatory results in ML?
 I ended up writing him a fair amount while I wan on a plane. My response to him is replicated here in full.
Hey Hawk,
Thanks for asking this question. It is a really important one and it is always nice to think about these problems in a fair amount of depth.</description>

      <description>Project Description The Machine Learning community of practice was a one stop shop for all things machine learning at Nielsen. The goal of the organization was to provide resources related to machine learning. We recorded all of the different projects being worked on related to machine learning, who were the different machine learning experts in different fields and maintained general learning resources.
We hosted monthly webinars that highlighted different machine learning projects around the organization and provided a forum for practitioners to present their work and get feedback.</description>

      <description>What I Did at Nielsen My first job after completing undergrad was as a Data Scientist at Nielsen. Nielsen is a market research company that provides insight about what people buy and what media content they consume. I was a part of Nielsen&amp;rsquo;s early career program focused on fast tracking individuals to leadership roles. The program consists of four six months rotations for a total of two years. During my time at Nielsen I wrote about what I worked on and what I was learning.</description>

      <description>Project Description Nielsen receives data from retailers about all of the items they sell. For example, Walmart sends Nielsen all of the products sold at each store in the past week. Brands, such as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, use this information to see how much of their product is being bought. Some retailers do not send Nielsen their data. We will refer to these retailers as non-cooperators. Non-cooperators do not send Nielsen their data because the majority of the items they sell are from their own brand.</description>

      <description>Project Description Nielsen is best known for their linear television ratings which estimate the number of people who were watching a channel at any time. This information is estimated using a representative panel of households all across the United States. Households in Nielsen&amp;rsquo;s Panel report all of the television that they watch. Each household&amp;rsquo;s viewing is weight based on its demographics to ensure that the viewing is representative of the population.</description>

      <description>Project Description Nielsen is in the process of transforming how we build our products. We are a ninety five year old company that is not technologically native. We are working on building products that are more maintainable and reducing the amount of work that we duplicate. Data science in particular is undergoing a large transformation within Nielsen. Previously, Data Science sat very far away from the final product and a large portion of the data science organization did not have the technical skills to build reliable technical products.</description>

Summary This paper is a qualitative analysis of thirty interviews with data scientists about their data exploration process. The interviews focus on the different tools that they use, how they are used and what functionality data scientists still desire. The paper shows how different this exploration process can be for different data scientists and how they all use different tools.</description>

Summary The authors of the paper present a juypter lab extension called verdant that keeps track of notebook history. The goal of verdant is to to help data scientists answer questions about their research process even if they have not documented everything along the way. The need for this tool is motivated by how messy and non-linear the data scientist process is.</description>

      <description>One of my friends and teammates asked me for some feedback about what he should be working on during the frisbee off-season. I wrote him an email explaining about how I think about getting better in the off-season before sending him some personal feedback. I thought sending this email would help contextualize how I think about getting better and reaching our goals. Some of the information in here, can be applied to really any skill, not just getting better at frisbee.</description>

Summary The authors propose that machine learning models should be accompanied by documentation known as &amp;ldquo;model cards&amp;rdquo;. A model card should outline who built the model, what the purpose of the model is, how it was validated and what it&amp;rsquo;s performance is according to many different metrics. The authors focus on models that are making decisions about humans.</description>

      <description>By Roy Schwartz, Jesse Dodge, Noah A. Smith, Oren Etzioni
Summary The authors of this post argue that a large percentage of machine learning research focuses on Red AI and make a call for more research to be centered on Green AI. The authors define Red AI and Green AI as follows:  Red AI: research that makes small improvements on the state of the art by leveraging more computation resources Green AI: research that focuses on diminishing the amount of computation necessary to reach a result.</description>

Summary This paper creates a model of how scientific researchers make progress towards the truth. By examining this process under different conditions the authors were able to identify what characteristics help lead scientists towards the truth. This work was motivated by understanding the role that reproducibility has in the research process. Through experiments with different conditions the authors were able to reach some conclusions about how reproducibility and other characteristics affect a communities ability to find the truth.</description>

      <description>By Jessica Horan-Block &amp;amp; Elizabeth Tuttle Newman
Summary This paper by two attorneys at Bronx Defenders argues that quick, decisive, and aggressive action can return children to parents after abuse allegations much faster than traditional approaches. The authors outline how minority and low income parents are more frequently accused of abuse. Parents will bring their children to the Emergency Room in response to accidental injuries or strange physical developments. When the parents explanation for how the injury occurred is not deemed sufficient by the physician, they will be accused of abuse.</description>

      <description>It is that time of year again when every website is publishing some piece of content trying to sum up 2018. Whether it is Facebook, posting a video that is your year in review, or a march madness style bracket to determine what person, place, or thing won 2018, everybody is attempting to summarize the past year.
A lot has happened over the past year. In 2018, I graduated college and started my first full time job.</description>
