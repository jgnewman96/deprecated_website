      <title>Catch and Kill</title>

      <description>Reading Catch and Kill by Ronan Farrow was a real eye opener for me. I knew who Harvey Weinstein was but I did not know any of the details. A lot of the events covered in the book happened while I was in college when I did not really follow the news.
My largest takeaway was that while the book might be centered on Harvey Weinstein, it is actually about so much more than any individual man.</description>

      <description>Normal People by Sally Rooney is one of my most anticipated books in the past couple of years. I had heard from many different sources about how good this book is. Family, friends and numerous co-workers all recommended it highly. It is relatively rare that I hear praise about a book from so many different sources.
I can see why so many different people enjoyed Rooney&amp;rsquo;s writing. She does an incredible job portraying emotion and what it feels like to be in your late teens / early twenties.</description>

      <description>I was introduced to this book through Stratechery and Exponent. One of the co-hosts of Exponent, James Allworth, is a co-author of this book. While I have been reading Ben Thompson&amp;rsquo;s (the author of Stratechery) writing for a couple years now, I knew a lot less about Allworth and his background. While James is a co-author of this book, the book is written from the perspective of Clayton Christensen. Christensen a professor at Harvard Business School, is best known for his work The Innovator&amp;rsquo;s Dillema.</description>

      <title>What are we looking for in a politician?</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/personal/politican_ideaology_leadership/</link>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/personal/politican_ideaology_leadership/</guid>
      <description>We have been taught to support political candidates whose ideology most nearly matches our own. While being ideological aligned with a candidate is important, not enough weight is given to candidates other traits. As an organization grows larger, the success of the organization is determined less by the vision or execution of the leader and more by the leaders ability to listen and empower others. The United States political system is so large and unwieldy that the impact of a president is not felt through their ideology but their ability to successfully run a large organization.</description>

      <description>I have read a book by Ta-Nehisi Coates each of the past two years. I read Between the World and Me two years ago and We Were Eight Years In Power last year. Both books demonstrated Coates impressive ability to forcefully convey powerful ideas. Coates is a masterful essayist. I listened to him and his editor Chris Jackson discuss The Water Dancer on the podcast Longform. I was quite excited to read Coates first novel and see how his writing style translated to a completely different medium.</description>

      <description>I have read a lot of &amp;ldquo;pop&amp;rdquo; science books and Good Economics for Hard Times is easily the best. Duflo and Banerjee explore very complex topics with nuance. They do an incredible job of conveying where there is uncertainty and what we know more definitively. Duflo and Banerjee both review the existing literature and expand upon potential future directions. Good Economics for Hard Times provides structure for thinking about complex problems like immigration or automation.</description>

      <description>The weekend of February 22 2020, my partner Jenny and I attended a mediation retreat at Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Marin. I wanted to attend a meditation retreat for a while, but never put in the effort to figure out the logistics before. I was looking through different meditation centers around the Bay Area in the fall and landed on Spirit Rock because it practices insight meditation. Insight meditation is the most accessible to me because it less focused on formality or any sort of rigidity.</description>

      <description>Before reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance I had no knowledge about what genre the book was or what it would be about. I actually potentially had some misconceptions about the content of the book. While I reading it, I actually thought it was a piece of fiction. Only when I read the afterword did I learn that it was actually semi auto-biographical. My friend Abhisaar recommended this book and I finally got around to it after about two years.</description>

      <description>Braiding Sweet Grass is a set of short stories about nature from Robin Kimmerer&amp;rsquo;s life. Kimmerer blends a scientific perspective with a perspective from from her heritage as a Native American. While each story is about an individual relationship between humans and nature, she often makes larger points about how human view themselves in the world. Kimmerer questions human&amp;rsquo;s claim of intelligent supremacy, challenges some of our economic systems and laments different ways our society is narrow minded.</description>

      <description>By Fredrick P Brooks
Summary This paper was published in 1986 examining the difficulties of creating software. Brooks argues that there is no silver bullet to make software development a lot easier. The main things that are making software development hard are part of the essence of software development. Rather than aiming for a silver bullet that will greatly improve software development we should be making smaller iterative improvements.</description>

      <description>Sing, Unburied Sing is a novel by Jesmyn Ward set in the American South. As with Ward&amp;rsquo;s other books, the novel does such an incredible job of getting inside characters heads. Ward is able to convey characters as nuanced individuals. She shows the darkest parts of our internal minds, how complex and convoluted they can be.
Sing, Unburied Sing feels like it is building towards something for the first half of the book.</description>

Carson explores the dangers of pesticides from so many different angles building up an intense amount of evidence of the dangers of pesticides. She highlights how harmful pesticides are to many different parts of our planet. The book is nothing if not repetitive show casing over and over again how we are doing damage to the planet with pesticides.</description>

      <description>This was a talk given at the American Economic Association (AEA) conference at the beginning of January 2020 by Marianne Bertrand. I was recommended this talk by Jenny Wang.
Summary Bertrand begins her talk by highlighting that overall gender differences / bias are heading in the right direction. We see an optimistic story when we look at the wrong trends in gender differences. There are more females in the labor force and less of a difference in girls schooling.</description>

      <description>Summary This paper explores matching in two sided markets through the multi armed bandit problem. An example of a two sided market we can model using multi armed bandits is matching workers to employees. There is a pool of workers and a pool of employees. We want to find the optimal matching of employees and workers. Employees have preferences over workers, and workers have preferences over employees. There has been a lot of working that examines how to achieve an optimal matching.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2020/am/</guid>
      <description>American Marriage by Tayari Jones is an absolutely gripping novel about a couple where the husband goes to jail for a crime he did not commit. The novel is written from the perspective of three different characters in long form first person monologues. I have not read a book in a while that was as gripping as American Marriage. There is something so powerful about first person internal monologues. The book is paced in a way that things are constantly turning and changing in different directions.</description>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/papers/2020/gelman_vf_mrp/</guid>
      <description>Summary The authors outline that due to decreasing performance of phone polls new approaches to political polling are becoming prominent. These new methods of getting survey responses do not get perfectly random samples. The authors argue we can use new statistical methods to make accurate inference without random samples.
The authors lay out the following work flow:
 Draw a survey sample directly from the voter database or matching responses from an already existing survey to the database Use auxiliary data from the database to construct a flexible statistical model on the quantity (or quantities) of interest Project inferences from the statistical model to the full target population on an individual level Use the projected individual-level inferences, which can be seen as a pseudo-survey dataset, to construct larger group-level inferences about either the electorate as a whole or subgroups within the electorate.</description>

      <description>By Paul H. Garthwaite, Joseph B. Kadane and Anthony O’Hagan
Summary This paper is an overview of how to take experts believes and turn them into statistical distributions. It combines a long line of psychology research with statistics research. The situation we are examining is when we want to create a distribution over a value from an experts opinion. It is impossible to ask an expert to give us a probability distribution so we need a methodology to query an expert that allows us to create the distribution ourselves.</description>

      <title>2019 in Review: The Books I Read</title>

      <description>As another year passes I reflect on what I did over the past year and what I learned. Looking back it is tempting to focus on what has changed over the past year. It is tempting to compare where I am now and where I was a year ago. I have moved to a new city and started a new job. But comparing one year to another is so divorced from the actual experience of a year.</description>

      <description>There Eyes Were Watching God is a novel about Janie, an African American Women born shortly after the end of slavery. The novel follows her she moves through three different husbands and living situations. This book is the most well known piece of literature by Zora Neale Hurston. The book is often read in English classes in either high school or college. I never read There Eyes Were Watching God in school; I was in the other 10th grade english class.</description>

      <description>Lords of the Realm by John Helyar chronicles the history of baseball through the eyes of the owners. We generally learn about the history of sports through the great players and their influence on the game. This book looks at the owners and how they shaped the game of baseball as it developed. The book is particularly focused on the labor relations between the players and the owners.
This book showed a completely different side of baseball history than I am used to.</description>

      <description>In the past year there has been a large focus on what is wrong with the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Coverage has focused on limitations of current deep learning and machine learning systems. Pieces have highlighted the dangers of implementing systems without understanding their implications or who they are going to impact. These pieces have highlighted areas where these fields need to grow. Machine Learning is still a relatively young field that needs to grow and learn.</description>

      <description>Jenny, my wonderful partner in crime and teammate, had her birthday last month. I got her a Nintendo Switch, with the game Overcooked. Overcooked is a cooking simulation game. You are in a kitchen with other chefs and you have to collaborate to make customers dishes. While simple in concept, Overcooked is quite deep in how it forces you to work together. The levels are set up so that the only way you can succeed is by delegating and working together.</description>

      <description>My Year of Rest and Relaxation by Otessa Moshfegh is quite a trip. The reader is taken inside the mind of a young adult living in New York who is trying to sleep for a entire year. The main character&amp;rsquo;s parents died and she recently left her job. She is using medication to sleep as much as possible. She hopes that after a year of sleeping she will be able to have a new start and be divorced from the darkness of her previous life.</description>

      <description>Creativity Inc was a fantastic book looking at the culture of Pixar. It explained the founding of Pixar and how the founders maintain an intense focus on developing a fantastic culture. The founders believe that if they maintain a good culture, their business will thrive. A successful business is not about having a great product plan, but developing a good culture and empowering smart people.
I appreciated that the book did not prescribe easy solutions but discussed everything with nuance.</description>

      <description>Washington Black by Esi Edugyan was quite an enjoyable piece of historical fiction. Here are a couple of different themes that personally stuck out to me.
Science as an equalizer The book played around a couple of different times with the idea that science and viewing the world through a scientific lens is an equalizer. That if you viewed the world through a scientific lens then you would not discriminate against certain people and you would be better able to see the truth.</description>

I learned an immense amount and became a much better data scientist. I met a lot of very smart people who helped me grow and taught me a lot. There were a lot of frustrations though during my time at Nielsen and I thought it would be worthwhile to expand upon why I am leaving.</description>

      <description>The Omnivore&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma by Michael Pollan was an absolutely fascinating read. I enjoyed learning more about our food insutry and how the human food chain has developed. The central question of the book was where does our food come from? What seems like such a simple question has become quite complex in our modern society. I learned a lot by watching Michael try to answer this question.
 While this book dealt explicitly with our food chain, it raises a lot of questions about the complexity of our society today.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Dominik Moritz at Apple/CMU and Kanit &amp;ldquo;Ham&amp;rdquo; Wongsuphasawat at Apple
Motivation So what is declarative data visualization? As programmers we are used to imperative programming. Imperative programming is specifying how to do a problem. For example you say, put a red circle here and put a blue circle there. It couples the specification with the execution. In declarative programming we only specify what should be done. We would say map x and y to specific position, not how to max x and y.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Josh Tobin works at Open Ai and Full stack Deep Learning. Talk Resources
Motivation Troubleshooting neurel nets is hardest part of building a deep model. Even the best practitioners spend a long time trouble shooting. Josh argues that the vast majority of what the best practitioners do to troubleshoot their models can be broken down to a decision tree. During this talk he presents that decision tree.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Jason Yosinski. He works at Uber AI Labs and Recursion Pharmaceuticals
Motivation We train and use neural netwroks but we have a very minimal grasp on how they actual work. We have created systems that can beat humans players in games and actually create robots that can work. We have made huge advances in creating systems that can do impressive things. Most of the this improve has been driven by increase in computation and increase in amounts of data.</description>

      <description>AI Lifecycle Model Management: Monitoring for Risk, Bias and Fairness Talk given by Sepideh Seifzadeh
The first keynote was about how can we as data scientists monitor for risk, bias and fairness. The speaker motivated the tech by saying that AI and data regulation is coming. There is more data being collected, Machine Learning capabilities have increased and the cost of storage is now a lot lower.
The speaker highlighted how we do not have defined mechanisms in place to handle when their are problems with AI.</description>

      <description>I read this book because of a recommendation from my friend Hawkins. I had previously read a couple of other books by Ursula Le Guin. I absolutely loved both Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed. Both were sci-fi books that were actually commentaries on human society. I cannot get enough of books like that. Hawk had mentioned that this book was about a communist society and what that would look like.</description>

      <description>Talk given by David Rolnick University of Pennsylvania and founder of Climate Change AI
Motivation Climate change as an important issues does not need that much motivation. We have all seen what has been happening California recently with the wild fires. There has been increasingly severe impacts from human influence on our climate system.
One thing that is important to recognize about climate change is that different parts of the world are impacted differently.</description>

Motivation What most practitioners of deep learning do is train models. Training models that do something is the easy part. The hard part is actually evaluating and testing those models. Most people evaluate their models by tieing them to a certain set of data and seeing the accuracy on that data. This has problem because it is tied to a given set of data and the potential problems with that data.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Jacob Andreas
Motivation Ideally we have systems that understand us in our natural language and can do things. We are beginning to have autonomous agents in the world around us. Both agents in the virtual world such a personal assistants and agents in the physical world like Roombas. We want to build automated agents that can take actions based on natural language

      <description>Talk given by Michael I Jordan
What is Machine Learning? The talk started by Professor Jordan defining what Machine Learning is. He said that machine learning is not some new field of research but it is rather the engineering extension of statistics. He calls back to how there was chemistry for a long time before there was chemical engineering. There was physics and electrical theory before there was electrical engineering.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Laurent El Ghaoui : Professor at BAIR and chief scientist at Sumup Analytics
This talk was about a new area of Deep Learning research that is still very much theory. In this approach rather than specifying the architecture of a given model, the data tells us the structure of our model. This approach provides for new notation and new conceptual ways for us to think about deep learning.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Jules Damji: git hub repo
Motivation Machine learning development is complex. This is not due to the underlying theory but rather all of the different stages in development. Each stage has its own requirements and goals. We have developed tools and best practices for this for traditional software development, but not Machine Learning.
Here are the differences between traditional software and machine learning

They both work at Tempus
Motivation Even if we build the most incredible thing, if it is not designed with users in mind, no body will use it. If we have built something that nobody will use, is it even incredible. If nobody is using what we have built than that is a failing.
We can build tools that users actually care about and will use if we take a user-centered design approach.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Boris Kovalerchuk , Slides
Motivation Boris motivated the need for visual techniques with an example on the Iris data set. He showed three different models for the Iris data set, shown below.
He highlighted that the problem with each of these analytical approaches is that they generalize to areas we have seen before. Ideally, instead we would have a model that classified points in space we had seen before and refused to classify points in the unknown space.</description>

      <description>My friend Hawkins recently sent me the following question:
 How do you work around biased data sets to produce non discriminatory results in ML?
 I ended up writing him a fair amount while I wan on a plane. My response to him is replicated here in full.
Hey Hawk,
Thanks for asking this question. It is a really important one and it is always nice to think about these problems in a fair amount of depth.</description>

      <description>Project Description The Machine Learning community of practice was a one stop shop for all things machine learning at Nielsen. The goal of the organization was to provide resources related to machine learning. We recorded all of the different projects being worked on related to machine learning, who were the different machine learning experts in different fields and maintained general learning resources.
We hosted monthly webinars that highlighted different machine learning projects around the organization and provided a forum for practitioners to present their work and get feedback.</description>

      <description>What I Did at Nielsen My first job after completing undergrad was as a Data Scientist at Nielsen. Nielsen is a market research company that provides insight about what people buy and what media content they consume. I was a part of Nielsen&amp;rsquo;s early career program focused on fast tracking individuals to leadership roles. The program consists of four six months rotations for a total of two years. During my time at Nielsen I wrote about what I worked on and what I was learning.</description>

      <description>Project Description Nielsen receives data from retailers about all of the items they sell. For example, Walmart sends Nielsen all of the products sold at each store in the past week. Brands, such as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, use this information to see how much of their product is being bought. Some retailers do not send Nielsen their data. We will refer to these retailers as non-cooperators. Non-cooperators do not send Nielsen their data because the majority of the items they sell are from their own brand.</description>

      <description>Project Description Nielsen is best known for their linear television ratings which estimate the number of people who were watching a channel at any time. This information is estimated using a representative panel of households all across the United States. Households in Nielsen&amp;rsquo;s Panel report all of the television that they watch. Each household&amp;rsquo;s viewing is weight based on its demographics to ensure that the viewing is representative of the population.</description>

      <description>Project Description Nielsen is in the process of transforming how we build our products. We are a ninety five year old company that is not technologically native. We are working on building products that are more maintainable and reducing the amount of work that we duplicate. Data science in particular is undergoing a large transformation within Nielsen. Previously, Data Science sat very far away from the final product and a large portion of the data science organization did not have the technical skills to build reliable technical products.</description>

Summary The authors of the paper present a juypter lab extension called verdant that keeps track of notebook history. The goal of verdant is to to help data scientists answer questions about their research process even if they have not documented everything along the way. The need for this tool is motivated by how messy and non-linear the data scientist process is.</description>

I wrote him an email explaining about how I think about getting better in the off-season before sending him some personal feedback. I thought sending this email would help contextualize how I think about getting better and reaching our goals. Some of the information in here, can be applied to really any skill, not just getting better at frisbee.</description>

Summary The authors propose that machine learning models should be accompanied by documentation known as &amp;ldquo;model cards&amp;rdquo;. A model card should outline who built the model, what the purpose of the model is, how it was validated and what it&amp;rsquo;s performance is according to many different metrics.

Summary The authors of this post argue that a large percentage of machine learning research focuses on Red AI and make a call for more research to be centered on Green AI. The authors define Red AI and Green AI as follows:  Red AI: research that makes small improvements on the state of the art by leveraging more computation resources Green AI: research that focuses on diminishing the amount of computation necessary to reach a result.</description>

Summary This paper creates a model of how scientific researchers make progress towards the truth. By examining this process under different conditions the authors were able to identify what characteristics help lead scientists towards the truth. This work was motivated by understanding the role that reproducibility has in the research process. Through experiments with different conditions the authors were able to reach some conclusions about how reproducibility and other characteristics affect a communities ability to find the truth.</description>

      <description>By Jessica Horan-Block &amp;amp; Elizabeth Tuttle Newman
Summary This paper by two attorneys at Bronx Defenders argues that quick, decisive, and aggressive action can return children to parents after abuse allegations much faster than traditional approaches. The authors outline how minority and low income parents are more frequently accused of abuse.

A lot has happened over the past year. In 2018, I graduated college and started my first full time job.</description>

      <description>I am a builder, problem solver, and a teammate . I push myself and those around me to think differently, to challenge the status quo and to focus on personal growth. I currently work as a Data Scientist at Change Research where we are improving American democracy through better public opinion insight. I grew up in New York City, went to college in Chicago where I studied computer science and economics and I now live in the Bay Area.</description>
