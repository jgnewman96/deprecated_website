Summary The authors begin the paper by highlighting that Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms have gotten a lot of attention recently for their ability to learn with less feedback. Multi-Armed Bandit approaches thrive in situations where we can not use a supervised approach and have to make decisions with minimal feedback. This paper is a survey of the top recent developments in the field. They authors introduce a taxonomy to classify different types of MAB problems and explain the state of the art in each category.</description>

Motivation Ideally we have systems that understand us in our natural language and can do things. We are beginning to have autonomous agents in the world around us. Both agents in the virtual world such a personal assistants and agents in the physical world like Roombas. We want to build automated agents that can take actions based on natural language
How do we design agents? We can break down the agent design problem in the following way.</description>
