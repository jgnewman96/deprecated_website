      <title>WES: Agent-based User Interaction Simulation on Real Infrastructure</title>

      <description>By Facebook Research
Papers Motivation Large distributed software systems with many users interacting are difficult to fully test. There are large numbers of edge cases which are difficult to identify ahead of time. Lots of bugs arise from complex interactions between users and the software that only occur at scale.
Papers Contribution This paper outlines the general principles of web enabled simulations (WES). The development of Facebook&amp;rsquo;s WW simulation is used to guide a discussion of WES in general.</description>

      <title>What is Ai Literacy? Competencies and Design Considerations</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/papers/2020/ai_literacy/</link>

      <description>By Duri Long and Brian Magerko
Paper Motivation Artificial Intelligence is increasingly integrated into user-facing technology but public understanding is limited. We need more research investigating what users need to effectively interact with AI and how to design learner centered AI technologies that increase user understanding.
Paper Contribution This paper formally defines AI literacy based on other existing research. The authors synthesize interdisciplinary research into a set of core competencies. They also make design suggestions for creating learner centered AI</description>

      <title>An Experimental Study of Structural Diversity in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/papers/2020/structural_diversity_experiment/</link>

      <description>By Jessica Su, Krishna Kamath, Aneesh Sharma, Johan Ugander, and Sharad Goel
This paper from Twitter and Stanford has the following motivation:
 The theory of structural diversity predicts that individuals derive increased utility from interacting with people from different parts of their social network. Previous evidence for this theory comes from observational studies which makes it difficult to make any casual statement.  So what is structural diversity? People consider the actions of their social contacts when making decisions.</description>

      <title>A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing</title>

      <description>By Linda Flower and John R. Hayes
Summary This is an older paper from 1981. The authors provide a model to answer the following question &amp;ldquo;What guides the decisions writers make when they write?&amp;rdquo;
The paper is organized in four different sections that build on top of each other. The authors collected data using a protocol analysis where participants were asked to write an essay for Seventeen Magazine about their job.</description>

      <title>Creativity Inc.</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2019/creativity/</link>

      <description>Creativity Inc was a fantastic book looking at the culture of Pixar. It explained the founding of Pixar and how the founders maintain an intense focus on developing a fantastic culture. The founders believe that if they maintain a good culture, their business will thrive. A successful business is not about having a great product plan, but developing a good culture and empowering smart people.
I appreciated that the book did not prescribe easy solutions but discussed everything with nuance.</description>

      <title>Declarative Data Visualization with Vega-Lite and Altair</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/talks/odsc/vega_altair_odsc/</link>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/talks/odsc/vega_altair_odsc/</guid>
      <description>Talk given by Dominik Moritz at Apple/CMU and Kanit &amp;ldquo;Ham&amp;rdquo; Wongsuphasawat at Apple
Motivation So what is declarative data visualization? As programmers we are used to imperative programming. Imperative programming is specifying how to do a problem. For example you say, put a red circle here and put a blue circle there. It couples the specification with the execution. In declarative programming we only specify what should be done. We would say map x and y to specific position, not how to max x and y.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Design for Data Scientists</title>

      <description>By Annie Darmofal and Katie Malone
They both work at Tempus
Motivation Even if we build the most incredible thing, if it is not designed with users in mind, no body will use it. If we have built something that nobody will use, is it even incredible. If nobody is using what we have built than that is a failing.
We can build tools that users actually care about and will use if we take a user-centered design approach.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Boris Kovalerchuk , Slides
Motivation Boris motivated the need for visual techniques with an example on the Iris data set. He showed three different models for the Iris data set, shown below.
He highlighted that the problem with each of these analytical approaches is that they generalize to areas we have seen before. Ideally, instead we would have a model that classified points in space we had seen before and refused to classify points in the unknown space.</description>
