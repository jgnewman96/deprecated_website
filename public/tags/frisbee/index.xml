      <description>Jenny, my wonderful partner in crime and teammate, had her birthday last month. I got her a Nintendo Switch, with the game Overcooked. Overcooked is a cooking simulation game. You are in a kitchen with other chefs and you have to collaborate to make customers dishes. While simple in concept, Overcooked is quite deep in how it forces you to work together. The levels are set up so that the only way you can succeed is by delegating and working together.</description>

      <description>One of my friends and teammates asked me for some feedback about what he should be working on during the frisbee off-season. I wrote him an email explaining about how I think about getting better in the off-season before sending him some personal feedback. I thought sending this email would help contextualize how I think about getting better and reaching our goals. Some of the information in here, can be applied to really any skill, not just getting better at frisbee.</description>
