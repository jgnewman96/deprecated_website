      <description>Transcendent Kingdom is Yaa Gyasi&amp;rsquo;s second novel. I really enjoyed reading Homegoing a couple of years ago which made me excited to pick up this novel. The novel is told from the perspective of Gifty a neuroscience PHD student who grew up in Alabama. Gifty&amp;rsquo;s mom emigrated from Ghana with her husband shortly after Gifty&amp;rsquo;s older brother was born. The novel tells the story of Gifty&amp;rsquo;s life by intermingling stories from the past with the present.</description>

      <description>Beloved by Toni Morrison is truly a heart breaking novel. It builds up to that heartbreak in an incredibly nuanced manner. It does not throw you directly into what happened with Sethe or what her past is like. It tells the story from a couple of different perspectives with different pieces getting peeled back in different ways. The book keeps you unsettled by slowly revealing more information. This leads to a greater understanding of Sethe and why she took the actions that she did.</description>

      <description>The Color Purple has been my list since I went to a meditation retreat earlier this year led by Rhonda Magee. She highly recommended reading this novel and remarked a number of times about how powerful it is.
The Color Purple touches on a couple of deep and complex subjects in a short space. It conveys emotions on these subjects in a different way because it is a piece of fiction.</description>

      <description>Wow, this book absolutely wrecked me. It is easily one of the saddest books I have read recently. It is a different kind of sad than other sad books I have read. Non-fiction often can be quite sad. But this book is just heartbreaking in how relatable it is. The stories are not wrapped up with nice clean resolutions. Characters do not always get redemption. The stories just really hit home.</description>

      <description>On Earth We&amp;rsquo;re Briefly Gorgeous By Ocean Vuong is a novel from the perspective of a narrator writing to his mother. The narrator recounts many different stories from his childhood and his relationship with different influences in his life. The letter jumps all over the place recounting stories about his Grandma&amp;rsquo;s life, to segments from the narrators point of view now that he is an adult.
This book reminded me in a lot of ways of some passages in Severance.</description>

      <description>Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo is a mix of a novel with a set of short stories. Each chapter is told from the perspective of a different women in England. Some of the stories are set in the present and some of them are set a hundred years ago. The stories cover a vast range of different experiences from people who grew up very poor to people who grew up with some wealth.</description>

      <description>Conversations with Friends is the second book in the past month that I have read by Sally Rooney. Similarly to Normal People, this novel explores communication between people in romantic relationships. It highlights the dangers and destructive nature of expecting others to understand us. When we expect others to understand rather than communicating there will be failures. We make assumptions about how other people are processing events and get caught in the world inside our heads.</description>

      <description>Severance by Ling Ma is easily one of my favorite books of the year. Severance elegantly ties together many different genres. It is an immigrant story, a coming of age story, a story about heritage and an apocalypse story. Ma blends these different stories into one cohesive narrative. Often during apocalypse novels the majority of the focus is on surviving and how the world has changed. Tieing the apocalypse to an individual&amp;rsquo;s history allowed us to explore how Candace&amp;rsquo;s past impacted her actions during the apocalypse.</description>

      <description>Normal People by Sally Rooney is one of my most anticipated books in the past couple of years. I had heard from many different sources about how good this book is. Family, friends and numerous co-workers all recommended it highly. It is relatively rare that I hear praise about a book from so many different sources.
I can see why so many different people enjoyed Rooney&amp;rsquo;s writing. She does an incredible job portraying emotion and what it feels like to be in your late teens / early twenties.</description>

      <description>I have read a book by Ta-Nehisi Coates each of the past two years. I read Between the World and Me two years ago and We Were Eight Years In Power last year. Both books demonstrated Coates impressive ability to forcefully convey powerful ideas. Coates is a masterful essayist. I listened to him and his editor Chris Jackson discuss The Water Dancer on the podcast Longform. I was quite excited to read Coates first novel and see how his writing style translated to a completely different medium.</description>

      <description>Before reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance I had no knowledge about what genre the book was or what it would be about. I actually potentially had some misconceptions about the content of the book. While I reading it, I actually thought it was a piece of fiction. Only when I read the afterword did I learn that it was actually semi auto-biographical. My friend Abhisaar recommended this book and I finally got around to it after about two years.</description>

      <description>Sing, Unburied Sing is a novel by Jesmyn Ward set in the American South. As with Ward&amp;rsquo;s other books, the novel does such an incredible job of getting inside characters heads. Ward is able to convey characters as nuanced individuals. She shows the darkest parts of our internal minds, how complex and convoluted they can be.
Sing, Unburied Sing feels like it is building towards something for the first half of the book.</description>

      <description>American Marriage by Tayari Jones is an absolutely gripping novel about a couple where the husband goes to jail for a crime he did not commit. The novel is written from the perspective of three different characters in long form first person monologues. I have not read a book in a while that was as gripping as American Marriage. There is something so powerful about first person internal monologues. The book is paced in a way that things are constantly turning and changing in different directions.</description>

      <description>There Eyes Were Watching God is a novel about Janie, an African American Women born shortly after the end of slavery. The novel follows her she moves through three different husbands and living situations. This book is the most well known piece of literature by Zora Neale Hurston. The book is often read in English classes in either high school or college. I never read There Eyes Were Watching God in school; I was in the other 10th grade english class.</description>

      <description>My Year of Rest and Relaxation by Otessa Moshfegh is quite a trip. The reader is taken inside the mind of a young adult living in New York who is trying to sleep for a entire year. The main character&amp;rsquo;s parents died and she recently left her job. She is using medication to sleep as much as possible. She hopes that after a year of sleeping she will be able to have a new start and be divorced from the darkness of her previous life.</description>

      <description>Washington Black by Esi Edugyan was quite an enjoyable piece of historical fiction. Here are a couple of different themes that personally stuck out to me.
Science as an equalizer The book played around a couple of different times with the idea that science and viewing the world through a scientific lens is an equalizer. That if you viewed the world through a scientific lens then you would not discriminate against certain people and you would be better able to see the truth.</description>
