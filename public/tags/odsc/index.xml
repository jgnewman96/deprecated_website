      <description>Talk given by David Rolnick University of Pennsylvania and founder of Climate Change AI
Motivation Climate change as an important issues does not need that much motivation. We have all seen what has been happening California recently with the wild fires. There has been increasingly severe impacts from human influence on our climate system.
One thing that is important to recognize about climate change is that different parts of the world are impacted differently.</description>

Motivation What most practitioners of deep learning do is train models. Training models that do something is the easy part. The hard part is actually evaluating and testing those models. Most people evaluate their models by tieing them to a certain set of data and seeing the accuracy on that data. This has problem because it is tied to a given set of data and the potential problems with that data.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Jacob Andreas
Motivation Ideally we have systems that understand us in our natural language and can do things. We are beginning to have autonomous agents in the world around us. Both agents in the virtual world such a personal assistants and agents in the physical world like Roombas. We want to build automated agents that can take actions based on natural language
How do we design agents?</description>

      <description>Talk given by Michael I Jordan
What is Machine Learning? The talk started by Professor Jordan defining what Machine Learning is. He said that machine learning is not some new field of research but it is rather the engineering extension of statistics. He calls back to how there was chemistry for a long time before there was chemical engineering. There was physics and electrical theory before there was electrical engineering.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Laurent El Ghaoui : Professor at BAIR and chief scientist at Sumup Analytics
This talk was about a new area of Deep Learning research that is still very much theory. In this approach rather than specifying the architecture of a given model, the data tells us the structure of our model. This approach provides for new notation and new conceptual ways for us to think about deep learning.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Jules Damji: git hub repo
Motivation Machine learning development is complex. This is not due to the underlying theory but rather all of the different stages in development. Each stage has its own requirements and goals. We have developed tools and best practices for this for traditional software development, but not Machine Learning.
Here are the differences between traditional software and machine learning
Traditional Software:
 Meet a functional specification Quality depends on the code One software stack  Machine Learning</description>

      <description>By Annie Darmofal and Katie Malone
They both work at Tempus
Motivation Even if we build the most incredible thing, if it is not designed with users in mind, no body will use it. If we have built something that nobody will use, is it even incredible. If nobody is using what we have built than that is a failing.
We can build tools that users actually care about and will use if we take a user-centered design approach.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Boris Kovalerchuk , Slides
Motivation Boris motivated the need for visual techniques with an example on the Iris data set. He showed three different models for the Iris data set, shown below.
He highlighted that the problem with each of these analytical approaches is that they generalize to areas we have seen before. Ideally, instead we would have a model that classified points in space we had seen before and refused to classify points in the unknown space.</description>
