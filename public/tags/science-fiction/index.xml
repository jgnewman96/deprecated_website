      <title>Exhalation</title>

      <description>Exhalation by Ted Chiang is a set of short stories that really showcases some of what I love about sci-fi. Chiang uses each story to explore our contemporary culture in a way that is only possible through sci-fi. Good science fiction is not writing about a different. It is writing about our own society and using other places to provide a context that would not be possible otherwise. By looking at and asking questions about what the world would look like in other scenarios we can better understand our own world.</description>

      <description>Hyperion by Dan Simmons is likely to join the group of sci-fi series where I read the first novel in the series and then do not read the others. This in no way means that I did not enjoy the book, but I find the first book in sci-fi series to be the most compelling. The world building and the introduction of characters is so gripping. There are so many books out there that I am compelled to read and so I often do not continue with the series.</description>

      <title>Severance</title>

      <description>Severance by Ling Ma is easily one of my favorite books of the year. Severance elegantly ties together many different genres. It is an immigrant story, a coming of age story, a story about heritage and an apocalypse story. Ma blends these different stories into one cohesive narrative. Often during apocalypse novels the majority of the focus is on surviving and how the world has changed. Tieing the apocalypse to an individual&amp;rsquo;s history allowed us to explore how Candace&amp;rsquo;s past impacted her actions during the apocalypse.</description>

      <description>I read this book because of a recommendation from my friend Hawkins. I had previously read a couple of other books by Ursula Le Guin. I absolutely loved both Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed. Both were sci-fi books that were actually commentaries on human society. I cannot get enough of books like that. Hawk had mentioned that this book was about a communist society and what that would look like.</description>
