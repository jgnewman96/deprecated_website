      <description>Severance by Ling Ma is easily one of my favorite books of the year. Severance elegantly ties together many different genres. It is an immigrant story, a coming of age story, a story about heritage and an apocalypse story. Ma blends these different stories into one cohesive narrative. Often during apocalypse novels the majority of the focus is on surviving and how the world has changed. Tieing the apocalypse to an individual&amp;rsquo;s history allowed us to explore how Candace&amp;rsquo;s past impacted her actions during the apocalypse.</description>

      <description>I read this book because of a recommendation from my friend Hawkins. I had previously read a couple of other books by Ursula Le Guin. I absolutely loved both Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed. Both were sci-fi books that were actually commentaries on human society. I cannot get enough of books like that. Hawk had mentioned that this book was about a communist society and what that would look like.</description>
