      <title>Towards Fine-grained Flow Forecasting: A Graph Attention Approach for Bike Sharing Systems</title>

      <description>By Suining He and Kang Shin
Paper Motivation Accurate bike-flow prediction at the station level is important for a bike sharing service&amp;rsquo;s success. Existing methods are not successful at predicting fine-grained bike flow.
Paper Contribution The authors remedy this problem by proposing a spatiotemporal graph attention CNN for station-level flow prediction. Each bike station is a node and bike rides are edges on a graph. Their network captures differing station-to-station correlations.</description>

      <description>Paper Motivation Model builders may want to ensure their model is fair with regard to a protected attribute. (E.g. Wanting to make sure our model is not discriminating against people because of their race). Previous research has shown that quantifying a model&amp;rsquo;s fairness is not straight forward. Even if the protected attribute is not an input to the model it is still possible that the model is discriminatory.
Paper Contribution The authors present a methodology of adjusting a learned predictor to remove discrimination according to their definition of discrimination.</description>

      <title>Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest </title>

      <description>Twitter and Tear Gas By Zeynep Tufekci is a pointedly insightful read. I had been planning to read it ever since she was interviewed on Stratechery. It felt like a really good time to read this book with the BLM protests going on across the world. Twitter and Tear Gas is part a history of modern protests, part a personal reflection and part a deep dive on the societal impacts of technology.</description>

      <title>Hacking the Electorate: How Campaigns Percieve Voters</title>

      <description>Hacking the Electorate By Eitan Hersh is an depth look at what information is accessible to campaigns and how they use that information to interact with voters. Hersh contextualizes his work by highlighting that he is focusing on the perspective of a campaign. A lot of previous research is through the lense perspective of voters. Hersh&amp;rsquo;s main argument is that by looking through the perspective of campaigns we can understand how campaigns perceive voters.</description>

      <title>What are we looking for in a politician?</title>

      <description>We have been taught to support political candidates whose ideology most nearly matches our own. While being ideological aligned with a candidate is important, not enough weight is given to candidates other traits. As an organization grows larger, the success of the organization is determined less by the vision or execution of the leader and more by the leaders ability to listen and empower others. The United States political system is so large and unwieldy that the impact of a president is not felt through their ideology but their ability to successfully run a large organization.</description>

      <description>By Jessica Horan-Block &amp;amp; Elizabeth Tuttle Newman
Summary This paper by two attorneys at Bronx Defenders argues that quick, decisive, and aggressive action can return children to parents after abuse allegations much faster than traditional approaches. The authors outline how minority and low income parents are more frequently accused of abuse. Parents will bring their children to the Emergency Room in response to accidental injuries or strange physical developments. When the parents explanation for how the injury occurred is not deemed sufficient by the physician, they will be accused of abuse.</description>
