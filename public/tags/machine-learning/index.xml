      <description>AI Lifecycle Model Management: Monitoring for Risk, Bias and Fairness Talk given by Sepideh Seifzadeh
Why do we care about data regulation?
 increased collection of data low cost storage Machine Learning capabilities have increased &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; doing more things , more unintended consequences or harms  Why is there going to be AI regulation - how is it going to protect us from harm - could regulation be bad, could it stifle innovation, regulation has some harms and some nefits - should we incremental make laws or make a new set of rules</description>

      <description>Talk given by David Rolnick University of Pennsylvania and founder of Climate Change AI
Motivation Climate change as an important issues does not need that much motivation. We have all seen what has been happening California recently with the wild fires. There has been increasingly severe impacts from human influence on our climate system.
One thing that is important to recognize about climate change is that different parts of the world are impacted differently.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Michael I Jordan
What is Machine Learning? The talk started by Professor Jordan defining what Machine Learning is. He said that machine learning is not some new field of research but it is rather the engineering extension of statistics. He calls back to how there was chemistry for a long time before there was chemical engineering. There was physics and electrical theory before there was electrical engineering.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Jules Damji: git hub repo
Motivation Machine learning development is complex. This is not due to the underlying theory but rather all of the different stages in development. Each stage has its own requirements and goals. We have developed tools and best practices for this for traditional software development, but not Machine Learning.
Here are the differences between traditional software and machine learning
Traditional Software:
 Meet a functional specification Quality depends on the code One software stack  Machine Learning</description>

      <description>My friend Hawkins recently sent me the following question:
 How do you work around biased data sets to produce non discriminatory results in ML?
 I ended up writing him a fair amount while I wan on a plane. My response to him is replicated here in full.
Hey Hawk,
Thanks for asking this question. It is a really important one and it is always nice to think about these problems in a fair amount of depth.</description>

      <description>Project Description Nielsen is best known for their linear television ratings which estimate the number of people who were watching a channel at any time. This information is estimated using a representative panel of households all across the United States. Households in Nielsen&amp;rsquo;s Panel report all of the television that they watch. Each household&amp;rsquo;s viewing is weight based on its demographics to ensure that the viewing is representative of the population.</description>

      <description>By Margaret Mitchell, Simone Wu, Andrew Zaldivar, Parker Barnes, Lucy Vasserman, Ben Hutchinson, Elena Spitzer, Inioluwa Deborah Raji, Timnit Gebru
Summary The authors propose that machine learning models should be accompanied by documentation known as &amp;ldquo;model cards&amp;rdquo;. A model card should outline who built the model, what the purpose of the model is, how it was validated and what it&amp;rsquo;s performance is according to many different metrics. The authors focus on models that are making decisions about humans.</description>

      <description>By Roy Schwartz, Jesse Dodge, Noah A. Smith, Oren Etzioni
Summary The authors of this post argue that a large percentage of machine learning research focuses on Red AI and make a call for more research to be centered on Green AI. The authors define Red AI and Green AI as follows:  Red AI: research that makes small improvements on the state of the art by leveraging more computation resources Green AI: research that focuses on diminishing the amount of computation necessary to reach a result.</description>
