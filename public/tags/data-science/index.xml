      <description>Notes Chapter 3 in Bayesian Method for Hackers is center on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). It is possible to use pymc3 and bayesian models without understanding the underlying algorithms. Understanding this algorithms plays a pivotal role though if we want to be serious practitioners. When our model works out perfectly, not knowing the underlying algorithms is fine. But if we are trying to do anything complicated, our first attempt will almost certainly not work.</description>

      <description>Notes The chapter explains the syntax of pymc3 and how to turn different concepts into pymc3 code. It outlines the difference between a stochastic variable and determinstic variable
 A stochastic variable is random. This means even if all the information about the variable is known, we do not know what its value is. Drawing a value from a distribution is a stochastic variable. A deterministic variable can be determined from its parameters.</description>

      <title>Workflow State Machine: Letter to Tushar</title>

      <description>I have been think about my workflow a lot of late decided to write my friend Tushar a letter. Here is that letter in full.
Hey Tush,
I hope you are getting some good relaxation in this weekend. It is a rainy day here in Baton Rouge so we are trapped inside. I have been thinking a lot about my work flow since reading that Gelman piece post I forwarded you.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Methods for Hackers: Prologue and Chapter 1</title>

      <description>Bayesian Methods for Hackers is an online textbook created by Cam Davidson Pilon. The book focuses on bridging the gap from theory to practice. The author argues that textbooks often focus on theory to the point where they become inaccessible. By focusing on accessability these methods become avaliable to anyone.
Notes The first chapter begins with an outline of how to think in a bayesian frameworks. Bayesian methods are our process of updating beliefs after seeing new evidence.</description>
