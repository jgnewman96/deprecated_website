      <description>What is the relationship of interest? What is the ideal experiment identification strategy mode of inference
descriptive is interesting but we want to learn about cause and effect - a causual relationship allows us to think about counterfactuals or how things would have been differdnt in a different state of the world - this allows us to think about a change in policy - if we just see an association it does not allow us to think about how things change</description>

      <description>Talk given by Michael I Jordan
What is Machine Learning? The talk started by Professor Jordan defining what Machine Learning is. He said that machine learning is not some new field of research but it is rather the engineering extension of statistics. He calls back to how there was chemistry for a long time before there was chemical engineering. There was physics and electrical theory before there was electrical engineering.</description>
