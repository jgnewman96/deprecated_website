      <description>By Andrew Gelman and Guido Imbens
Paper Motivation Most statistics and economics literature focuses on the effect of a treatment not what caused an outcome.
Paper Contribution The authors argue that the search for a cause can be understood in a traditional statistical framework. We can think about identifying causes using model checking and hypothesis generation.
Background A map shows a high density of cancers in a small geographic region. This immediately leads to some questions â†’ What is going on here?</description>

      <description>I had waited to read this classic paper By Kenneth Arrow for a long time now. Since I started working in the political sphere I have been interested in how to best represents people&amp;rsquo;s opinions and how to aggregate them. This paper is so impressive because it works directly from first principles and makes all of its assumptions quite clear.
Arrow begins by asserting there are two methods by which social choices can be made in a democracy.</description>

  What is the casual relationship of interest?

      <title>Good Economics for Hard Times</title>

      <description>I have read a lot of &amp;ldquo;pop&amp;rdquo; science books and Good Economics for Hard Times is easily the best. Duflo and Banerjee explore very complex topics with nuance. They do an incredible job of conveying where there is uncertainty and what we know more definitively. Duflo and Banerjee both review the existing literature and expand upon potential future directions. Good Economics for Hard Times provides structure for thinking about complex problems like immigration or automation.</description>

      <description>This was a talk given at the American Economic Association (AEA) conference at the beginning of January 2020 by Marianne Bertrand. I was recommended this talk by Jenny Wang.
Summary Bertrand begins her talk by highlighting that overall gender differences / bias are heading in the right direction. We see an optimistic story when we look at the wrong trends in gender differences. There are more females in the labor force and less of a difference in girls schooling.</description>

      <title>Competing Bandits in Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/papers/2020/bandits_matching_markets/</link>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/papers/2020/bandits_matching_markets/</guid>
      <description>Summary This paper explores matching in two sided markets through the multi armed bandit problem. An example of a two sided market we can model using multi armed bandits is matching workers to employees. There is a pool of workers and a pool of employees. We want to find the optimal matching of employees and workers. Employees have preferences over workers, and workers have preferences over employees. There has been a lot of working that examines how to achieve an optimal matching.</description>

      <description>Lords of the Realm by John Helyar chronicles the history of baseball through the eyes of the owners. We generally learn about the history of sports through the great players and their influence on the game. This book looks at the owners and how they shaped the game of baseball as it developed. The book is particularly focused on the labor relations between the players and the owners.
This book showed a completely different side of baseball history than I am used to.</description>

      <description>Talk given by Michael I Jordan
What is Machine Learning? The talk started by Professor Jordan defining what Machine Learning is. He said that machine learning is not some new field of research but it is rather the engineering extension of statistics. He calls back to how there was chemistry for a long time before there was chemical engineering. There was physics and electrical theory before there was electrical engineering.</description>
