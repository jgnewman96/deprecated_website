      <description>By Lucas Bernardi, Tehmis Mavridis, Pablo Estevez
Summary This paper from Booking is not focused on algorithmic advances but on how the company has derived value from using Machine Learning. The authors argue that more papers similar to this one need to be published.
The authors highlight some parts of the Machine Learning process that are specific to booking. They do this to explain why there situation is different then other technology firms.</description>

      <description>By Fredrick P Brooks
Summary This paper was published in 1986 examining the difficulties of creating software. Brooks argues that there is no silver bullet to make software development a lot easier. The main things that are making software development hard are part of the essence of software development. Rather than aiming for a silver bullet that will greatly improve software development we should be making smaller iterative improvements.</description>

      <description>Project Description Nielsen is in the process of transforming how we build our products. We are a ninety five year old company that is not technologically native. We are working on building products that are more maintainable and reducing the amount of work that we duplicate. Data science in particular is undergoing a large transformation within Nielsen. Previously, Data Science sat very far away from the final product and a large portion of the data science organization did not have the technical skills to build reliable technical products.</description>

      <description>By Sara Alspaugh, Nava Zokaei, Andrea Liu, Cindy Jin, Marti A. Hearst
Summary This paper is a qualitative analysis of thirty interviews with data scientists about their data exploration process. The interviews focus on the different tools that they use, how they are used and what functionality data scientists still desire. The paper shows how different this exploration process can be for different data scientists and how they all use different tools.</description>

      <description>By Mosca, Abigail and Robinson, Shannon and Clarke, Meredith and Redelmeier, Rebecca and Coates, Sebastian and Cashman, Dylan and Chang, Remco
Summary The authors of this paper use interviews of 14 data scientists to characterize how a data scientist takes business requirements and turns it into a project. The authors call this process of taking a clients needs and turning it into an analysis plan initialization. The authors specifically focus on how data scientists interact with non-technical clients.</description>

      <description>By Mary Beth Kery, Bonnie E. John, Patrick O’Flaherty, and Amber Horvath, Brad A. Myers
Summary The authors of the paper present a juypter lab extension called verdant that keeps track of notebook history. The goal of verdant is to to help data scientists answer questions about their research process even if they have not documented everything along the way. The need for this tool is motivated by how messy and non-linear the data scientist process is.</description>
