      <description>Project Description Nielsen is in the process of transforming how we build our products. We are a ninety five year old company that is not technologically native. We are working on building products that are more maintainable and reducing the amount of work that we duplicate. Data science in particular is undergoing a large transformation within Nielsen. Previously, Data Science sat very far away from the final product and a large portion of the data science organization did not have the technical skills to build reliable technical products.</description>

Summary This paper is a qualitative analysis of thirty interviews with data scientists about their data exploration process. The interviews focus on the different tools that they use, how they are used and what functionality data scientists still desire. The paper shows how different this exploration process can be for different data scientists and how they all use different tools.</description>

Summary The authors of the paper present a juypter lab extension called verdant that keeps track of notebook history. The goal of verdant is to to help data scientists answer questions about their research process even if they have not documented everything along the way. The need for this tool is motivated by how messy and non-linear the data scientist process is.</description>
