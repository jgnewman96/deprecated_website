      <description>Golden Gates by Conor Daugherty tells a meandering story of housing in the Bay Area. It combines individual stories focused on specific actors with a larger look at housing policy. We hear about community activists, politicians and people being forced from their homes. It combines a larger argument about problems with housing with an in depth looking at how the housing crisis impacts individual people.
Reading The Color of Law by Richard Rothstein gave me a sense of historical patterns and how the housing market has become so inequitable.</description>
