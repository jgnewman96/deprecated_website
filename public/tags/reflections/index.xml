      <description>Woof&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; The past couple of months have been such a whirlwind. It has both been quite long and quite short. I guess that is just the way it goes. I have done a bad job of taking time to do personal work. You might have noticed the lack of posts since the end of September. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I have not been reading or writing. But, I have not set aside the time to take what I have been doing and put it on this website.</description>

      <description>For the past two weeks, I have been working through Me &amp;amp; White Supremacy, Layla Saed&amp;rsquo;s month long interrogation of white supremacy. I am reading the book, journaling each day and then meeting with a group of co-workers weekly to discuss our experience. While journaling, I noticed my tendency to gravitate toward simple solutions. The chapters about tone policing and cultural appropriation were quite challenged. I was looking for specific guidelines about what my behavior should look like.</description>

Some of the stories are set in the present and some of them are set a hundred years ago. The stories cover a vast range of different experiences from people who grew up very poor to people who grew up with some wealth.</description>

      <title>Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self Delusion</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2020/trick_mirror/</link>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/2020/trick_mirror/</guid>
      <description>Trick Mirror by Jia Tolentino is a series of essays exploring identity and the self in our current era. Tolentino blends personal stories and self reflections with larger dissections of structural systems in our society. I found Tolentino&amp;rsquo;s writing incredibly compelling. She does not prescribe absolutes and allows nuance to shine through. She does not prescribe exact solutions but rather examines structures in our society and how she navigates them.</description>

      <description>I have been think about my workflow a lot of late decided to write my friend Tushar a letter. Here is that letter in full.
Hey Tush,
I hope you are getting some good relaxation in this weekend. It is a rainy day here in Baton Rouge so we are trapped inside. I have been thinking a lot about my work flow since reading that Gelman piece post I forwarded you.</description>

      <description>I was introduced to this book through Stratechery and Exponent. One of the co-hosts of Exponent, James Allworth, is a co-author of this book. While I have been reading Ben Thompson&amp;rsquo;s (the author of Stratechery) writing for a couple years now, I knew a lot less about Allworth and his background. While James is a co-author of this book, the book is written from the perspective of Clayton Christensen. Christensen a professor at Harvard Business School, is best known for his work The Innovator&amp;rsquo;s Dillema.</description>

      <title>What are we looking for in a politician?</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/personal/politican_ideaology_leadership/</link>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/personal/politican_ideaology_leadership/</guid>
      <description>We have been taught to support political candidates whose ideology most nearly matches our own. While being ideological aligned with a candidate is important, not enough weight is given to candidates other traits. As an organization grows larger, the success of the organization is determined less by the vision or execution of the leader and more by the leaders ability to listen and empower others. The United States political system is so large and unwieldy that the impact of a president is not felt through their ideology but their ability to successfully run a large organization.</description>

      <description>Before reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance I had no knowledge about what genre the book was or what it would be about. I actually potentially had some misconceptions about the content of the book. While I reading it, I actually thought it was a piece of fiction. Only when I read the afterword did I learn that it was actually semi auto-biographical. My friend Abhisaar recommended this book and I finally got around to it after about two years.</description>

      <title>2019 in Review: The Books I Read</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/books/year_review_2019/</link>

      <description>As another year passes I reflect on what I did over the past year and what I learned. Looking back it is tempting to focus on what has changed over the past year. It is tempting to compare where I am now and where I was a year ago. I have moved to a new city and started a new job. But comparing one year to another is so divorced from the actual experience of a year.</description>

      <description>There Eyes Were Watching God is a novel about Janie, an African American Women born shortly after the end of slavery. The novel follows her she moves through three different husbands and living situations. This book is the most well known piece of literature by Zora Neale Hurston. The book is often read in English classes in either high school or college. I never read There Eyes Were Watching God in school; I was in the other 10th grade english class.</description>

      <description>In the past year there has been a large focus on what is wrong with the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Coverage has focused on limitations of current deep learning and machine learning systems. Pieces have highlighted the dangers of implementing systems without understanding their implications or who they are going to impact. These pieces have highlighted areas where these fields need to grow. Machine Learning is still a relatively young field that needs to grow and learn.</description>

      <description>Jenny, my wonderful partner in crime and teammate, had her birthday last month. I got her a Nintendo Switch, with the game Overcooked. Overcooked is a cooking simulation game. You are in a kitchen with other chefs and you have to collaborate to make customers dishes. While simple in concept, Overcooked is quite deep in how it forces you to work together. The levels are set up so that the only way you can succeed is by delegating and working together.</description>

      <description>Washington Black by Esi Edugyan was quite an enjoyable piece of historical fiction. Here are a couple of different themes that personally stuck out to me.
Science as an equalizer The book played around a couple of different times with the idea that science and viewing the world through a scientific lens is an equalizer. That if you viewed the world through a scientific lens then you would not discriminate against certain people and you would be better able to see the truth.</description>

      <title>Leaving Nielsen</title>
      <link>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/industry/nielsen/leaving/</link>

      <guid>https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/writing/industry/nielsen/leaving/</guid>
      <description>Why I am leaving Nielsen Nielsen was my first experience working at a full time job and in a lot of ways it was a good one. I learned an immense amount and became a much better data scientist. I met a lot of very smart people who helped me grow and taught me a lot. There were a lot of frustrations though during my time at Nielsen and I thought it would be worthwhile to expand upon why I am leaving.</description>

      <description>It is that time of year again when every website is publishing some piece of content trying to sum up 2018. Whether it is Facebook, posting a video that is your year in review, or a march madness style bracket to determine what person, place, or thing won 2018, everybody is attempting to summarize the past year.
A lot has happened over the past year. In 2018, I graduated college and started my first full time job.</description>
