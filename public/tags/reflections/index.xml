      <description>Why I am leaving Nielsen Nielsen was my first experience working at a full time job and in a lot of ways it was a good one. I learned an immense amount and became a much better data scientist. I met a lot of very smart people who helped me grow and taught me a lot. There were a lot of frustrations though during my time at Nielsen and I thought it would be worthwhile to expand upon why I am leaving.</description>

A lot has happened over the past year. In 2018, I graduated college and started my first full time job.</description>
