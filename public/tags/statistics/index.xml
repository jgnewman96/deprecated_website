      <description>Notes The chapter explains the syntax of pymc3 and how to turn different concepts into pymc3 code. It outlines the difference between a stochastic variable and determinstic variable
 A stochastic variable is random. This means even if all the information about the variable is known, we do not know what its value is. Drawing a value from a distribution is a stochastic variable. A deterministic variable can be determined from its parameters.</description>

      <description>Discrete Distributions A discrete distribution on has specified values, such as integers. It has a probability mass function.
Poisson The poisson distribution expresses the probability that a given number of events occur in a time interval. The larger the lambda the more times the event will occur.
$$P(Z=k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$
$$ E[Z| \lambda] = \lambda $$
The poisson distribution provides a probability for any positive integer.
A larger lambda gives more to higher values.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Methods for Hackers: Prologue and Chapter 1</title>

      <description>Bayesian Methods for Hackers is an online textbook created by Cam Davidson Pilon. The book focuses on bridging the gap from theory to practice. The author argues that textbooks often focus on theory to the point where they become inaccessible. By focusing on accessability these methods become avaliable to anyone.
Notes The first chapter begins with an outline of how to think in a bayesian frameworks. Bayesian methods are our process of updating beliefs after seeing new evidence.</description>

      <description>Summary The authors outline that due to decreasing performance of phone polls new approaches to political polling are becoming prominent. These new methods of getting survey responses do not get perfectly random samples. The authors argue we can use new statistical methods to make accurate inference without random samples.
The authors lay out the following work flow:
 Draw a survey sample directly from the voter database or matching responses from an already existing survey to the database Use auxiliary data from the database to construct a flexible statistical model on the quantity (or quantities) of interest Project inferences from the statistical model to the full target population on an individual level Use the projected individual-level inferences, which can be seen as a pseudo-survey dataset, to construct larger group-level inferences about either the electorate as a whole or subgroups within the electorate.</description>

      <description>By Paul H. Garthwaite, Joseph B. Kadane and Anthony O’Hagan
Summary This paper is an overview of how to take experts believes and turn them into statistical distributions. It combines a long line of psychology research with statistics research. The situation we are examining is when we want to create a distribution over a value from an experts opinion. It is impossible to ask an expert to give us a probability distribution so we need a methodology to query an expert that allows us to create the distribution ourselves.</description>

      <title>Rotation 1: Non-coop estimation</title>

      <description>Project Description Nielsen receives data from retailers about all of the items they sell. For example, Walmart sends Nielsen all of the products sold at each store in the past week. Brands, such as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, use this information to see how much of their product is being bought. Some retailers do not send Nielsen their data. We will refer to these retailers as non-cooperators. Non-cooperators do not send Nielsen their data because the majority of the items they sell are from their own brand.</description>

Summary This paper creates a model of how scientific researchers make progress towards the truth. By examining this process under different conditions the authors were able to identify what characteristics help lead scientists towards the truth. This work was motivated by understanding the role that reproducibility has in the research process. Through experiments with different conditions the authors were able to reach some conclusions about how reproducibility and other characteristics affect a communities ability to find the truth.</description>
