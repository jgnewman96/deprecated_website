      <description>We have been taught to support political candidates whose ideology most nearly matches our own. While being ideological aligned with a candidate is important, not enough weight is given to candidates other traits. As an organization grows larger, the success of the organization is determined less by the vision or execution of the leader and more by the leaders ability to listen and empower others. The United States political system is so large and unwieldy that the impact of a president is not felt through their ideology but their ability to successfully run a large organization.</description>
