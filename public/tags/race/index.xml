      <description>By Robin DiAngelo
The paper explores why white people are silent when talking about race. It argues that this silence, &amp;ldquo;White Silence&amp;rdquo; functions to maintain white power and privilege. The goal of the paper is to unsettle the complacency that often surrounds White Silence. TO motivate silent whites to stop being silent.
Whiteness is dynamic, relational and operating at all times and on myriad levels. It is not something simple and not easy to wrap our heads around.</description>

      <description>The Color of Law By Richard Rothstein provides an extensive history of discrimination in housing policy in the United States. Rothstein chronicles discrimination at all levels of government and in all facets of housing. Whether it is discrimination through zoning, mortgages or schools, different levels of government continued to find new ways to enforce segregation. Rothstein refutes that housing segregation is a result of people&amp;rsquo;s preferences. He shows that housing segregation is a direct result of governmental policies that still impact our country today.</description>

      <description>By Jessica Horan-Block &amp;amp; Elizabeth Tuttle Newman
Summary This paper by two attorneys at Bronx Defenders argues that quick, decisive, and aggressive action can return children to parents after abuse allegations much faster than traditional approaches. The authors outline how minority and low income parents are more frequently accused of abuse. Parents will bring their children to the Emergency Room in response to accidental injuries or strange physical developments. When the parents explanation for how the injury occurred is not deemed sufficient by the physician, they will be accused of abuse.</description>
