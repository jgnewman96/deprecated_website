<p>I have found it hard to execute on independent research projects while working full time. Currently the way I interact with researcher is mostly as a consumer. My recent reading and thinking has been in the space of fair AI.</p>

<h3 id="paper-reading">Paper Reading</h3>
<p>A necessary part of producing quality research is reading lots of other research. Any piece of research is not done in isolation but in dialogue with what came before it. Reading research only does so much, but finding weak points and expanding upon it can be illuminating. Me and my friend <a href="https://tusharc.dev/">Tushar</a> read one research paper a week and then discuss it. On this website I will summarize the paper and write some of my own thoughts about it.Â It is important to read research papers from a diverse set of fields. By reading other research papers we also learn what good research looks like and how to best communicate findings. You can view all of the papers that I am reading and my thoughts about them <a href="https://judahgnewman.netlify.com/categories/papers/">here</a></p>
<p>Here are some specific posts where my thoughts about the paper touch on some more general themes:</p>

<h4 id="human-computer-interaction--machine-learning">Human Computer Interaction + Machine Learning</h4>
<p>While machine learning is a very powerful tool, it is currently inaccessible to most people. Current algorithms  learn through methods very different than how humans natively learn. To teach a human how to recognize a cat you might explain what a cat is and show the human a couple of photos. To teach the machine you provide it with thousands of photos and tell it whether or not the photo has a cat in it. While the human is able to understand the core qualities of a cat from a few examples, it takes the machine thousands of examples and labels to understand what actually constitutes a cat.</p>
<p>During my undergraduate studies, I had the pleasure of conducting researching supervised by professor <a href="https://www.blaseur.com/">Blase Ur</a>. We explored whether humans could teach machines through a more complex and native interaction than just providing labels. Is there potential for humans to teach computers, through explanations for example? We studied this by conducting a human research study where we asked participants to provide labels and explanations for an image classification task. We characterized the different types of information participants provided and how it could be used to train an image classification system. We also did a follow up experiment demonstrating how the explanations could be used to jump start the training process.</p>
<p>I was first author on our paper that was presented at INTERACT 2019 in Paphos, Cyprus. Here is a link to the paper and my slides from the presentation</p>
