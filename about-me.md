Judah Newman 
=============

I am a builder, problem solver, and a friend. I push myself and those around me to think differently, to challenge the status quo and to focus on personal growth. I currently work as a Data Scientist at Nielsen as an Emerging Technologist in their Early Career Programs. I grew up in New York City, went to College in Chicago where I studied computer science and economics and I now reside in the Bay Area. I spend a lot of my time playing and training for Ultimate Frisbee. I am an avid cook, mediocre meditator and a so-so journaler.
