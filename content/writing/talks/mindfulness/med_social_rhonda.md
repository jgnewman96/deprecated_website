The weekend of February 22 2020, my partner Jenny and I attended a mediation retreat at Spirit Rock meditation center in Marin. I have been wanting to go to a meditation retreat for a while, but never had figured it out logistically. I was looking through different meditation centers around the Bay Area in the fall and landed on Spirit Rock because it practiced insight meditation. Insight meditation always spoke to me because it was not focused on formality or any sort of rigidity. It always felt the most accessible.

The meditation retreat that we attend was titled the **The Inner Work of Social Justice: Socially Engaged Mindfulness** led by Rhonda Magee. We picked this retreat because it seemed to bring a different perspective and focus to mindfulness then we had previously been exposed to. The retreat was Saturday and Sunday from 10am - 4:30PM. The retreat consisted of individual sits, walking meditations, lectures and some interpersonal exercises.

Here are chronicled some assorted thoughts from the weekend:

- One feeling that kept coming forward during my sits over the weekend was fear. While on a day to day basis it might not feal like a lot of fear is present in my life, I started to notice that fear underlies a lot of my actions and thoughts. During childhood fear can often be present and seen as trivial. Fear of monsters under the bed, fear of the house catching fire. From reflection, it does not seem like all the fear goes away but rather takes different forms as we grow up. Instead of being scared of a robber entering my house, I have a deeper hidden fear of failing. I have a fear that my actions do not matter or that what I does does not have an impact. This fear can be so hidden that it can be hard to even see it is there during my day to day. I want to try and embrace that fear rather than run away from it or hide from it. Fear is such an over powering feeling that acknowledging it can be difficult. I am excited about doing more work to identify how fear is subtly pushing me in different ways and accepting that fear rather than getting rid of it.

- I struggle to connect my sits with the rest of my life. Regularly, I will sit down to meditate, focus on my breath for ten minutes and then go back to what I was doing. My headspace while I sit can seem so disconnected from my headspace during the rest of my life. My thinking will slow down and calm down while I am sitting, but for the rest of my time it will be so frenzied. This weekend helped me connect my sits better with the rest of my life. Mindfulness is not only about making time to sit through out the day. It is also about bringing mindful practices to all my interactions. In meetings if I take a moment to reflect, have a deep breath and then respond that is a way of bringing mindfulness outside of just the cushion. Going for a walk in nature and listening to the sounds I hear is another example of bringing mindfulness outside of just sitting. This weekend helped me recognize that mindfulness is not solely focused on meditation but incorporating actions into all facets of my life.

- Meditation can easily be seen as a very personal practice. It is the process of siting on your own, with your own thoughts. It can even feel isolating at times.This weekend opened my eyes to meditation being a cross personal experience. I have completed meditations that discussed how to use mindfulness to connect with others. I always viewed those kind of exercises as doing inner work, so that in other situations I can connect with others. This weekend showed me how mindfulness it self can focus on connecting with others. While that distinction might seem small that slight change in focus can be quite different. My headspace is very different doing inner work to help with connecting to others rather than directly sitting and focusing on working with others.

- During the weekend we did some group exercises that involved listening to others. We did one exercise that focused on how listening can amplify a voice. One a voice is acutely listened to that makes it a lot stronger. I want to bring that idea into all parts of my life. Be truly listening to someone else and hearing what they are saying, I can amplify what they are trying to say. It also made me recognize how much I struggle to listen to others. When I am listening I often am already thinking about what I want to say, assuming I know what the person is saying.

- Another reflection from this weekend was how much my worldview is centered on solving a problem or finding a solution. Whenever I am presented with a problem, I want so simplify it and understand it. I struggle to hold radical complexity. There is so much that is so complex, that I will not necessarily be able to understand it completely or simplify it. While it is still worthwhile to try and understand and break things down, it can also be a good practice to recognize the complexity. Recognize that any simplification does not contain all of that complexity and therefore is an incomplete perspective. One idea that Rhonda proposed is to view all of our answers as provisional answers. We are coming to an answer or conclusion that works for right now, but it is subject to change in the future. This kind of perspective goes very well with things I like about a bayesian perspective to uncertainty in statistics.

- During the weekend Rhonda highlighted how much wisdom there is our history. History holds lots of information about how people have joined together through difficult times. It holds information about how change has happened and how people have joined together. We can turn to our ancestors and their practices for insight. While I do not identify as part of any religion, there is a lot of wisdom in how religion provided value to individual's lives. Religion helped give people meaning and build important communities. Rather than turn away from religion because of some of the bad parts of organized religion, we can recognize the immense value it has provided to people. We can strive to build more institutions that provide similar value. We can form communities around certain values that support each other. We can use regular practices of meeting to reflect more and bring more consistency to our lives.
We should build new communities of support. It could be very powerful to belong to multiple communities of support focused on different things connecting with different people.

- My entire life so far has been working with in the current societal structure. I went through traditional educational institutions to eventually graduate and get a job. There has always been this idea in my head that I am working towards some later date where I will then be able to do the important things. I am working within the current societal structure and system to try and improve it slightly. I am working through the idea, that sometimes it is necessary to work outside of the system. That being with in the system inherently limits my worldview and does not allow me to see things outside of the system. If a system systematically hurts certain people, is it enough to just change things on the margins. Do we have to rethink the system all together? Some more thoughts on this to come at a later date.

- Relating to my earlier reflections on fear, I found that at times through out the weekend I felt fake or like an imposter. I felt like what I am doing with regard to social justice is not enough. That I have had so much privilege in my life. I should be spending more of my time volunteering and I should be donating more of my money. While all of this might be true, I want to reflect more on where the feeling of being an imposter comes from. What makes me feel like I belong, versus what makes me feel like I do not. Is there power in recognizing that no matter what I do, there are certain ways I cannot belong to certain things and that is okay. Some more thoughts on this to come at a later date as well.

- Rhonda posed the question to us about what a just world look likes. I came up the following tentative answer:

In a just society everyone is able to fully commit themselves to their curiosity. They are supported and empowered by love from others around them.

- One exercise from the weekend was to form a vow connected to how we think about social justive. I came up with the following vow:
**I vow to embrace fear and discover empowerment for myself and others through communities of support**
