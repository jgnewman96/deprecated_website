What is the relationship of interest? 
What is the ideal experiment 
identification strategy 
mode of inference 

* * * 

descriptive is interesting but we want to learn about cause and effect 
- a causual relationship allows us to think about counterfactuals or how things would have been differdnt in a different state of the world 
- this allows us to think about a change in policy 
- if we just see an association it does not allow us to think about how things change 

* * * 

how do we capture the causal effect of interest? 
ideal experiemnts are hypothetical but they are still helpful 

if you cant design an experiment in a world where anything goes how could you answer this question 

We cant answer questions when too many things are tangeled 
- does starting school later affect test score

springly examples through out is so helpful
