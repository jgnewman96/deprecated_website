## Discrete Distributions

A discrete distribution on has specified values, such as integers. It has a probability mass function.

### Poisson

$$P(Z=k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$

$$ E[Z| \lambda] = \lambda $$

The poisson distribution provides a probability for any positive integer.

A larger lambda gives more to higher values. A smaller lambda gives more probability to smaller values.


## Continuous Distributions

Can take on arbitrarily many values. It has a probability density function.

### Exponential Distribution

$$f_{z}(z | \lambda) = \lambda e^{- \lambda z} $$

$$ E[z | \lambda] = \frac{1}{\lambda} $$

A smaller lambda gives more density towards higher values.
