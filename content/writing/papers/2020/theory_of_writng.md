## Summary

paper from 1981

Paper is trying to provide a model to answer this question "What guides the decisions writers make when they write?"

1. it is a set of distinctive thinking process,
2. it is a hierarchical and embedded process,
3. the process is guided by the writers goals
4. there are high level goals and then smaller sub level goals

1.
the old model depicted it as a linear steps in different stages
    - a model of pre-write / write / re-write

pre-writing as helped improve the quality of writing by getting people to do more work before hand

this model is for what is actually on the piece of paper, not what is going on inside the person

writers are actually pre-writing and revising as they write

these models fail at understanding what goes on during a part and how the parts relate to each other

> in a stage model the major units of analysis are stages of completion which reflect the growth of a written product, and these stages are organized in a linear sequence or structure. In a process model, the major units of
analysis are elementary mental processes, such as the process of generating ideas.

*hierarchical structure* is important where some things are sub componets of another piece

they use protocol analysis to get thoughts from people as they are writing.

* * *

their model
- three major units: the task environment, the writer's long-term memory, and the writing processes.

they indetify parts:

we can start with the rhetorical problem
    - solve a problem by writing something

> If a writer's representation of her rhetorical problem is inaccurate or simply underdeveloped, then she is
unlikely to "solve" or attend to the missing aspects of the problem.


> each word in the growing text determines and limits the choices of what can come next.

> In the planning process writers form an internal repre- sentation of the knowledge that will be used in writing. This internal repre-sentation is likely to be more abstract than the writer's prose representation will eventually be.
    - outlines might just have key words or not be complete sentence

sub process of planning are generating ideas, organizing, grouping ideas and forming new concepts,

goal setting , defining the problem and setting your goals guide the process so much

translating is then taking the things from planning and putting them into writing

We can study children and how there writing process changes over time to become better writers ourselves

## Thoughts

The paper does such a good job at starting from a fundamental question and then just building it up from scratch
    - identify the major elements
    - show how the major elements relate
    - how does the model help you answer critical questions

This applies to a lot more than writing. While this is specific to writing it is applicable to many other places as well.

- I like that the focus should always be on future research
    Nevertheless, it is for us a working hypothesis and springboard for further research, and we hope that insofar as it suggests testable hypotheses it will be the same for others.

    A model such as the one presented here is first and foremost a tool for researchers to think with. By giving a testable shape and definition to our observations, we have tried to pose new questions to be answered.


Relate to Josh waitizikin: this is why you practice your scales, you need to turn these things into something you do not have to focus energy on so that you can focus your energy on other things.
    > If the writer must devote conscious attention to de-mands such as spelling and grammar, the task of translating can interfere with the more global process of planning what one wants to say.
