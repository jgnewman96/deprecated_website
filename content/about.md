I am a builder, problem solver, and a teammate . I push myself and those around me to think differently, to challenge the status quo and to focus on personal growth. I currently work as a Data Scientist at [Change Research](https://www.changeresearch.com/) where we are improving American democracy through better public opinion insight. I grew up in New York City, went to college in Chicago where I studied computer science and economics and I now live in the Bay Area. I spend a lot of my time playing and training for Ultimate Frisbee. I am an avid cook, mediocre meditator and a so-so journaler.
